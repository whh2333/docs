 With notification based publishing, you can create your post in Buffer, receive a notification on your mobile device when it’s time to post, then tap the notification and copy your post over to your Facebook group to finish posting. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Learn more about how this works here</a>.

<h2 id="FAQ-ag9wn">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why do I need to download the mobile app to post to Facebook groups?</h3>
<p>Meta's API does not support automatic posting to Facebook groups. Therefore, we use notification publishing to post your content, which requires the latest version of the Buffer app (available on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buffer-plan-schedule-posts/id490474324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.buffer.android" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Android</a>).</p>
<h3>If I have notifications set up for Instagram within the Buffer mobile app, do I need to set up notifications for Facebook groups too?</h3>
<p>Notifications within the Buffer app are channel specific, so you’ll still need to set up notifications for Facebook even if you’ve set up notifications for Instagram.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What happens if I schedule the same post for a Facebook page and a Facebook group?</h3>
<p>Facebook pages and groups are still linked in the composer, so if you schedule a post for a Facebook group and a Facebook page, the Facebook page post will get scheduled to publish automatically and the Facebook group post will be scheduled as a notification.&nbsp;</p>
