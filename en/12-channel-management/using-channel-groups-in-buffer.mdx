<ul>
 <li><b>Edit</b> a group by clicking the <b>pencil icon</b> next to its name.</li>
 <li><b>Delete</b> a group by clicking the <b>trash icon</b>.</li>

<h2 id="Using-channel-groups-in-the-composer-ojBU6">Using channel groups in the composer</h2>
<div>
 Once you've set up a channel group, you can use it directly when creating a post by selecting it at the top of the composer.
</div>
<ul>
 <li>At the top of the composer, you’ll see the name of your active channel group (e.g. <b>Luna Sneakers</b>) along with the number of channels within the group.</li>
 <li>All channels in the group will be selected by default. You can choose to unselect any individual channel if you don’t want to include it in the post.</li>
 <li>If a network doesn’t allow publishing to multiple accounts at once (e.g. X/Twitter), you’ll see a note with instructions to schedule posts separately.</li>
 <li>If you want to deselect all channels at once, choose <i><b>Unselect All. </b></i></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="FAQ-MjGce">FAQ</h2>
<h3>If I’m part of a team, are my channel groups available to my entire organization? Can I share my channel groups with my team?&nbsp;</h3>
<div>
 At this time, channel groups you create are only available to you. They will not be visible to your team and are not able to be shared with others.&nbsp;
</div>
<h3>Why is my new channel group showing up empty?</h3>
<p>A channel group may appear empty if the selected channels are no longer accessible to you. This can happen if:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You added a channel that you no longer have access to (for example, the Admin of your organization removed your access).</li>
 <li>The channel was deleted by an organization admin.</li>
 <li>The channel belonged to a different organization that you no longer belong to.</li>
</ul>
<p>To fix this, try re-adding available channels to the group or, if you're part of an organization, check with your team's Admin to confirm current access permissions.</p>
<h3>Can I add the same channel to multiple groups?</h3>
<p>Yes, a single channel can typically be included in more than one group.</p>
