        <p>As an individual Buffer user, you have your own organization with the ability to add your own personal social channels that only you have access to. You might also be part of another organization as a user with access to that organization's social channels.<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/674-getting-started-as-a-user-in-an-organization" target="_self"> Learn more about the levels of user permissions here.</a></p>
