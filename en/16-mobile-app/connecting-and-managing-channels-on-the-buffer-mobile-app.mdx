<h2 id="01H5SST6W54TSQAQCHHVB89WX7">Refreshing a channel</h2>
<p>When you connect a channel to Buffer, it creates an access token, which is like a key that the social network grants to Buffer, giving us permission to post on your behalf and pull in your analytics and comments.</p>
<p>Access tokens can expire for a number of reasons, including password changes, spam detection, and time-based lifespans set up by the social networks. While this can be frustrating, it‚Äôs important to remember that this is normal behavior and usually the result of the social network making updates to keep your account safe. <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/552-best-practices-for-keeping-your-social-channels-connected" target="_self">Learn best practices for keeping your social channels connected in our guide</a>.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Tap on the menu icon in the upper left of your screen.</li>
 <li>Select the channel you'd like to refresh.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>Tap the&nbsp;<em><strong>Settings&nbsp;</strong></em>icon at the bottom right of your screen.</li>
 <li>Tap&nbsp;<em><strong>Refresh this Channel connection.&nbsp;</strong></em></li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
 <li>Enter your login details, accept all permissions, and tap&nbsp;<em><strong>Authorize app</strong></em>.</li>
 <li>You should now be all set and can retry any failed posts in your queue.</li>
</ol>
<p>If your account still appears to have an expired access token, you may need to reauthorize Buffer within the social network itself to re-establishing the connection. You'll find the steps to <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-buffer#h_1aeb1368-aa97-4a89-b7e8-d63c4697de3a" target="_self">reauthorize Buffer through the social network here</a>, which are best completed on a desktop computer.</p>
