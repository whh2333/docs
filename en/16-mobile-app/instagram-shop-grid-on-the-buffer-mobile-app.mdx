        <p>Shop Grid is an Instagram grid-inspired landing page editable within your Buffer dashboard. With Shop Grid, you can guide followers from your Instagram "link in bio" to your online store and content without the use of third-party tools or design resources (and without changing your link every time you share a new post!).</p>

 <li>Here, you'll see your latest 100 published posts, along with any scheduled posts in your queue. You're able to add up to three custom links that will display at the top of your Shop Grid page. These are links that you may wish to highlight to your followers. For example, a link to your online store, a holiday sale, or event registration. <a href="https://buffer.com/shop-grid" target="_blank">See some cool examples from Buffer customers here</a>.</li>
