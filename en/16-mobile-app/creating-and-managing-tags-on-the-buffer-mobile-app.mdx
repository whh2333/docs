 <h3>üìù&nbsp;<b>A few important notes about tags</b></h3>
 <ul>
  <li><b>All users in your organization can view posts with tags</b>‚Äîeven if they don‚Äôt have access to the channel the post is scheduled for. While they can see the post under the Tags tab, they won‚Äôt be able to access the channel‚Äôs queue or click its avatar.</li>
  <li>Only&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC" target="_self">users with Admin access</a>&nbsp;can create, edit, or delete tags from the tags list.</li>
  <li>Users with <b>Full Posting Access</b> and <b>Approval Required Access</b> can add or remove tags from scheduled posts.</li>
  <li>There is a limit of <b>250 tags per account</b>.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h2 id="01EKCNKE4ZMJHKYVX3XRSEAT2H">Creating a tag and adding it to posts</h2>
<p>Before you can tag your posts, you'll need to create one! All it takes is coming up with a tag name. Here's how:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Tap the menu icon in the upper left of your screen (the three horizontal lines) and then scroll down to tap <em><strong>Manage Tags</strong></em>.</li>
 <li>Tap on the "+" key in the upper-right.</li>
 <li>Add your tag name, choose a color, and tap <em><strong>Create</strong></em>.</li>
</ol>
<p>To add a tag to a post you're creating, tap <i><b>Tag </b></i>and then tap the tag you'd like to use in your post.</p>
<p>If you're in the middle of a post and realize you haven't yet added a tag name you want to tag your post with, no worries! Just tap <strong><em>Tag </em></strong>in the composer, add the name of your tag in the "Enter tag name" field, and tap <b>+ Create '[your tag name]' </b>to finish the process.</p>

<h3 id="01H4Q9CYDWY5VC68VR60NKQF2P">Viewing tags</h3>

 To view stats from your tagged posts, as well as to see how many posts are queued or have been published, head to your "Tags" tab.

<ol>
 <li>Tap the menu button in the upper left of your screen and then tap <em><strong>Manage Tags</strong></em>.</li>
 <li>A list will come up of your current tags.</li>

<h3 id="01H4Q9FMDQECY7BNKKXXCQDQ0N">Editing or deleting tags</h3>
<p>To change the name or color of a tag, tap the select tag from the list of tags, edit the title or color, and click <b><i>Update.</i></b></p>
<p>To delete a tag, tap the select tag from the list, and then tap <em><strong>Delete</strong></em>. Deleting a tag will not delete the posts linked to that tag. If you‚Äôd like to stop those posts from being published, you will need to delete them individually.</p>
