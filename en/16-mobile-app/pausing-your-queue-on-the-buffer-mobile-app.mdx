 <ul>
  <li>Pausing your queue is done on a per-channel basis. If you have multiple channels that you'd like to pause, you will need to pause each queue individually.</li>
  <li>Once your queue is unpaused, the posts you had scheduled using the “Add to Queue” option will automatically be placed into the next available time slots (in the original order in which they were scheduled). Posts that were scheduled for a specific date and time that has since passed will show as failed and will need to be rescheduled or deleted.</li>
