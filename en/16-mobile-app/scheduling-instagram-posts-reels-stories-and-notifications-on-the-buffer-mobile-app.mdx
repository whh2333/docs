        <p>When you're using Buffer to publish to Instagram, you can either publish automatically to Instagram or set a notification to finish the post in the Instagram app yourself. This applies to reels and stories, too. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Learn more about how to use notification</a><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"> based publishing</a><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"> here.</a></p>

<p>Certain features (like scheduling a first comment) are available when publishing automatically to Instagram Professional accounts, while others (like adding music to a reel or stickers to a story) can only be added if you are scheduling to an Instagram Personal account or you set a notification and finish the post yourself on Instagram.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/554-using-instagram-with-buffer#h_01HB99SMK6389CZEMAG1XBP6K6">Learn more about how Buffer works on Instagram Personal accounts vs. Professional accounts here</a>.</p>
<div>
 Every time you create a post, story, or reel in Buffer, you can choose:
</div>
<div>
 <b>üü¢ Automatic - </b>Buffer will automatically post on your behalf so that you can focus on other things, like replying to comments or creating new content.
</div>
<div>
 <b>üü° Notify Me - </b>Add story stickers, music, product tags, story links, and enjoy more creative control. Buffer will set up your post, send you a notification, and help you finish the post yourself on Instagram. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Learn more about the process in our guide to notification</a><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"> based publishing</a><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">.</a>

</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <h4 id="01EKF7APGP42T3RCTMX89KYKXG">Notes</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Images and videos must be within Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range (between 4:5 and 1.91:1 for images and between 4:5, 16:9 for videos, and 9:16 for reels), in order to be published automatically. If the image or video falls outside of this range, the post will be scheduled as a notification instead.</li>
  <li>Videos must be between 3 and 60 seconds. Reels must be between 5 seconds and 15 minutes. If your video is not within this range, you'll see a message letting you know. You'll need to adjust the video and then re-upload it.</li>
  <li>Instagram Stories cannot be published automatically by Instagram creator accounts. Instead, you'll need to use the <i><b>Notify Me </b></i>open to finish publishing the post manually.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<ol start="5">
 <li>Type in or copy and paste the caption you'd like to use. (Note: to include a caption for a story, or music to a reel, you‚Äôll need to use the <i><b>Notify Me</b></i> option‚Äîsee next step for details).</li>
 <li>Tap <b><i>Change</i></b> to choose whether to use <b><i>Automatic </i></b>publishing or <b><i>Notify Me </i></b>to send a notification to finish posting later.
  <ul>
   <li><b>Note: </b>If you choose <b><i>Add Sticker</i></b> and select a feature that is not supported for automatic posting, such as <b><i>Music</i></b>, <b><i>Tag Product</i></b>, <b><i>Text, Link, </i></b>or <b><i>Topics</i></b> we'll switch your post to <b><i>Notify Me </i></b>so you'll get a notification and you can finish posting in Instagram. We'll also generate a text box for each Sticker so you can leave yourself a placeholder note about what music, text, story links, products or topics you want to add in the Instagram app when you finish publishing your post, reel, or story.</li>

 <li>You can add up to 20 tags on an image for a single image post.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 <li>For carousel posts, the tagged accounts in the image are carried over for each image in the carousel. When this happens, each image tag is added together for a total. If your draft has more than 20 tags, you may see an error and will need to edit the tags down for the carousel post to successfully publish.</li>
 <li>All tags in the first image automatically carry over to all other images in the carousel, counting towards the limit.</li>

 <h3>üìù Notes</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Due to limitations in Instagram's API, we can't auto-complete the @ handle, and you will need to enter the exact @ handle of the Instagram user you‚Äôd like to mention.</li>
  <li>We would strongly encourage you to check each link on the right-hand side to make sure the correct @ handle has been entered.</li>
  <li>Posts with tags for private or non-existent users will fail.</li>
