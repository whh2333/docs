        <p>With so much content on social media now, posts can easily get missed and lost in the flow. We understand that you need to get maximum visibility.</p>
<p>The Duplicate feature (formerly Share Again) allows you to add published posts back into your queue to share again. Due to social networks becoming much stricter on the duplication of content, we recommend using this feature lightly, and making changes to your posts before sharing them multiple times (<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/647-is-it-possible-to-schedule-one-post-to-repeat-multiple-times" target="_self">learn why here</a>).</p>
<div class="callout-red">
 <p>‚ö†Ô∏è There's currently a restriction when duplicating Facebook posts that limits Buffer from being able to copy the text of a Facebook post when duplicating it. Your images/videos will duplicate, but your text will not duplicate. We're working to resolve this.</p>
