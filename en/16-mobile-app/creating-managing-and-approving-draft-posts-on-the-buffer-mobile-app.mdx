<h2 id="01H4ERMV4DZYH8H51JTMGEDGX7">Accessing draft posts</h2>
<p>You can access your drafts by tapping the Drafts tab on the bottom menu of the app. Drafts that you or your team have composed on the web will also appear here.</p>
<h2 id="01EKCR12S1HJXCQH9GKC47D0CK">Creating, editing, and deleting draft posts</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Tap <em><strong>Create Post.</strong></em></li>
 <li>Once you're done composing, select <em><strong>Next</strong></em> and then choose <em><strong>Save as Draft</strong></em>.</li>
 <li>If you'd like to save the draft in a specific timeslot in your calendar or queue, choose <em><strong>Schedule as Draft.</strong></em></li>
 <li>To make modifications or to delete a draft post, tap <em><strong>Edit</strong></em> or <em><strong>Delete</strong></em> on the draft.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="01H4ERMV4D685JQXKWAT95CQZ3">Moving drafts to the queue</h2>
<p>Account owners and users with Full Posting Access can move any draft from the drafts list directly to the queue by tapping <em><strong>Add to Queue</strong></em>. Users with Approval Required access will tap <em><strong>Request Approval</strong></em> instead, and their post will land in the ‚ÄúPending Approval‚Äù tab.</p>

<h2 id="01EKCR1C0N7AC5EJGWJ6HQ4A5F">Managing draft posts</h2>
