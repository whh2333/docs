<h2 id="h_01GEF6BSD9JD8CQE4QCB4EXJ5Q">Overview of analytics</h2>
<p>With Buffer analytics, you have the option to view your posts' performance across all of your social channels in one glance or focus in on a specific social channel. You can find your advanced analytics via the <a href="https://analyze.buffer.com/" target="_blank">"Analyze" tab</a>.</p>
<p>In the analytics dashboard, your team members will be able to view metrics for any channel they have permission to access. Admins have the additional ability to create reports and access campaign metrics.</p>

 <p>üìù The Analyze dashboard supports analytics for <b>Facebook Pages, Instagram Business accounts, LinkedIn Company and Showcase Pages, and X/Twitter profiles</b>. The Analyze dashboard does not have integrations with Facebook profiles, Facebook groups, Instagram personal profiles, LinkedIn profiles, Pinterest accounts, TikTok accounts, YouTube Shorts, Google Business profiles, Mastodon, Threads, or Bluesky.</p>

<h4 id="01GEFXGP5F6Z3R1R21GXJJA9KV">Overview of all social channels</h4>
<p>Our "Home" page will consolidate all of your channels into one screen so you can get a high-level overview of how your posts are performing. The "Home" page is visible when you log into Buffer and first click the "Analyze" tab.</p>
<h4 id="01GEFXGP5FR2B8656BVN6FRMZE">Individual channel metrics</h4>
<p>To view the metrics for a specific social channel:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Select a social network on the left side of Buffer</li>
 <li>Then, select a social channel from the dropdown at the top of the screen. If you only have one channel for any of your social networks, it will automatically be selected. However, if you have multiple channels (e.g. multiple Instagram accounts), you'll see them all listed within the dropdown and you can select one to view its analytics.</li>
