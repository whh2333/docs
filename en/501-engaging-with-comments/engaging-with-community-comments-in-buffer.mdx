<h2 id="Understanding-your-Comment-Score--8yqO">Understanding your Comment Score</h2>
<div>
 Your Comment Score rates how engaged you are with your audience. It’s a helpful way to track how consistently and quickly you're responding to comments, which are key actions for building strong relationships with your community.
</div>
<h3 id="What-are-the-Comments-Score-levels--s88Jl"><b>What are the Comment Score levels?&nbsp;</b></h3>
<ul>
 <li>Getting Started: 0-20 points</li>
 <li>Finding Your Voice: 21-40 points</li>
 <li>Replying Regularly: 41-60 points</li>
 <li>Conversing Consistently: 61-80 points</li>
 <li>Community Champion: 81-100 points</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="What-factors-into-your-Comments-Score-vj0hI">What factors are included in your Comment Score?</h3>
<div>
 Your Comment Score is calculated based on three core engagement metrics:
</div>
<ul>
 <li><b>Response rate</b>: The percentage of comments you’ve replied to.</li>
 <li><b>Response speed</b>: How quickly you respond after a comment is posted.</li>
 <li><b>Consistency</b>: How regularly you engage with your audience.</li>
</ul>
<div>
 Together, these metrics give you a clear picture of your engagement habits and highlight areas for improvement.
</div>
<h3 id="Why-it-matters-TNDC-"><b>Why it matters</b></h3>
<div>
 Replying to comments helps you build trust, spark ongoing conversations, and strengthen your community. A higher Comment Score means you're staying present and responsive—something your followers will notice and appreciate.
</div>
<div>
 Even small improvements can make a big difference in how your brand is perceived. Whether you're aiming for faster replies or more consistent check-ins, your score is here to help guide you.
</div>

<h2 id="FAQ-kPrxE">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Can’t See Comments? Here’s What to Check</h3>
<ul>
 <li>If new comments aren’t coming in, there may be an issue with the connection between Buffer and your social channel. In that case, we recommend <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-buffer" target="_blank">refreshing your channel using these steps</a>.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>Only users with Full Posting access for the channel selected can see that channel’s comments. If you have Approval Required access, you won’t see comments for that channel. To change that, the Owner or an Admin of your Buffer organization can adjust your permissions. Here’s how to <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/671-changing-user-permissions-in-your-organization" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">change user permissions in your organization</a>.</li>
 <li>If you're still not seeing comments come through after trying these things, feel free to email us at hello@buffer.com, and we’ll be happy to help!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Which social networks are supported?&nbsp;</h3>
<div>
 At the moment, you can reply to comments on Threads, Instagram professional accounts, and Facebook pages through your Community tab. We plan to add more channels to Community in the future!
