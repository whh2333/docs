<p>In the video below, Katie, from our Customer Advocacy team, will walk you through how to understand labels and sentiments within our Engage tool.</p>

<h2 id="h_01EWKG09BT2HNGY37B5P13T7FH">The Question label</h2>
<p>Simply put, any comment that has contains ‘?’ or ‘¿’ will be labeled with a question mark icon in Buffer. This helps you easily identify which comments need an answer from you.</p>
<h2 id="h_01EWKG0FGCANQWEFCW1HBP4ZEN">The Order label</h2>
<p>We identify and label common words that are often found in comments that discuss an order or shipment. These words include:</p>
<p>‘order’, ‘package’, ‘shipping’, ‘shipment’, ‘shipped’, ‘tracking’, ‘delivery’, ‘deliveries’, ‘delivered’, ‘orders’, ‘ordered’, ‘pay’, ‘payment’, ‘paid’, ‘buy’, ‘bought’, ‘parcel’, ‘packet’, ‘post’, ‘postage’, ‘box’, ‘dispatch’, ‘Fedex’, ‘UPS’, ‘purchase’, ‘purchased’, ‘transaction’, ‘sale’, ‘sold’, ‘courier’, ‘address’, ‘consignment’, ‘mail’, ‘mailing’, ‘returns’, ‘refund’, ‘discount’, 'reimbursement’, ‘didn’t arrive’, ‘customs’, ‘size’, ‘sizes’</p>
<p>At the moment, you may find comments with the "order" label applied because one of the words above is included in a person’s username. We intend to improve this in the future to exclude usernames.</p>
<h2 id="h_01EWKG0MJP28NCZ3YKB2C2KXV6">The Negativity label</h2>
<p>We use machine learning to determine whether a comment might have a “negative” sentiment. Our model looks for certain words or word patterns that suggest the commenter is angry or upset. These comments will be labeled with an exclamation mark within Buffer.</p>
<h2 id="The-Giveaway-label-imVXq">The Giveaway label</h2>
<p>These posts are identified by a "gift" icon. If you’re running a giveaway, we’ve made it easy to dismiss all comments with one easy click! If your post contains any of the following words: ‘Giveaway’, ‘Contest’, ‘Concurso’ (Spanish), or ‘Sorteo’ (Spanish) and has between 20 and 2000 unanswered comments, you’ll see an option to <i><b>Dismiss All</b></i> comments in that post.</p>
