<p>We‚Äôre starting the effort slowly so that everyone can ease in to the process. This article will help lead you through what to expect when working through your email verification in Buffer. We are working to provide this service to everyone in the upcoming months.</p>

<h2 id="h_01HB9BZWY0SFSMZVBHMYDYHWC3">How to verify your email to add additional security to your Buffer account</h2>
<p>For new customers as of March 7th 2022, when you create your Buffer account, you‚Äôll receive an email asking you to verify your email address.</p>
<p>For old customers prior to this date, from your Buffer dashboard, click on your profile avatar and select&nbsp;<strong><em>Account.&nbsp;</em></strong>Within the&nbsp;<strong><em>Email Address&nbsp;</em></strong>section, click on<strong><em>&nbsp;Verify Email.&nbsp;</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>These are the next steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
 <li>Head to the email inbox associated with the email address connected to your Buffer account,</li>
 <li>Locate the email from hello@youraccount.buffer.com with the subject line, ‚ÄúConfirm your email address‚Äù,</li>
 <li>Open the email and click the button that says&nbsp;<em><strong>Confirm email</strong></em>&nbsp;to verify your email address.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01HB9BZWY0PKHRKDXC5E5DR9J7">What should I do if I didn‚Äôt receive the verification email?</h3>
<p>Didn't receive the email from hello@youraccount.buffer.com that you expected? There are several reasons that could be the case. Let's walk through a few steps together in efforts to complete your verification.</p>
<ol>
 <li>First, double-check that you're searching for our email in the inbox associated with the email address you have on file with Buffer.</li>
 <li><p>If you‚Äôre already in the correct email inbox, open a new web browser tab (not the mobile app) and login to your Buffer account to see if there‚Äôs a banner at the top of your dashboard. If there isn‚Äôt a banner, you‚Äôre all set and can discontinue your efforts to verify your email address, as we‚Äôre not ready with email verification on your account just yet.</p><p><i><b>If there is a banner there, head to the next step.</b></i></p></li>
 <li><p>If you‚Äôre still not seeing the email in your inbox, look in your Spam or Junk folders to see if it was rerouted there. As a reminder, the sender will be&nbsp;hello@youraccount.buffer.com&nbsp;and the subject line is "Confirm your email address." If you find the email, mark it as "Not Spam" or move it to your proper inbox and follow the instructions on the email to complete your verification.</p><p><i><b>Still didn‚Äôt find it? Head to the next step.</b></i></p></li>
 <li>Head back to your Buffer web dashboard and click the button in the banner up top that says,&nbsp;<em><strong>Resend verification</strong></em>. This triggers our system to send the same verification letter to your email address.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>If you‚Äôre still unable to verify your email address, we‚Äôd love to help! Submit a support ticket to <a href="mailto:hello@buffer.com">hello@buffer.com</a> using the topic ‚ÄúEmail verification help‚Äù and we‚Äôll get back to you as quickly as possible.</li>

<h2 id="Adding-a-backup-email-to-your-account-eaH7L">Adding a backup email to your account</h2>
<p>Adding a backup email to your account is a simple but important step to protect your access in case you ever lose access to your primary email.</p>
<h3>Why it matters</h3>
<p>Your backup email acts as a safety net. If you‚Äôre locked out of your main account email‚Äîfor example, if it gets deleted, hacked, you lose access to it, or you forget the password‚Äîwe can use your backup email to verify your identity and help you regain access quickly.</p>
<p>Without a backup email, recovery options may be limited, and restoring access could take longer or require additional verification steps.</p>
<h3>How to add a backup email</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Click your profile icon in the upper right corner of Buffer.</li>
 <li>Choose <i><b>Settings </b></i>from the dropdown menu.</li>
 <li>Under "Backup Email," enter a valid secondary email address that you have access to.</li>
 <li>Click <i><b>Save Changes. </b></i></li>
 <li><p>Check your backup email inbox for a confirmation message and click the verification link.</p><p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a76c80f4274338c746b035/file-jGuOuNac27.jpg" alt="Buffer account settings - adding a backup email" style="max-width: 100%; "></p></li>
</ol>
<p>Once verified, your backup email will be securely stored and used only for account recovery purposes.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <h3>üí° Tips:</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Choose an email address that you check regularly and that isn‚Äôt tied to the same domain as your primary email (in case there‚Äôs an outage).</li>
  <li>Keep your backup email up to date‚Äîespecially if you change jobs or email providers.</li>
 </ul>

<h2 id="Why-am-I-being-asked-to-verify-my-login-YX-s3">Why am I being asked to verify my login?</h2>
<p>If you see the screen pictured below, it means that Buffer doesn‚Äôt recognize your login. This is because you don't have two-factor authentication enabled, <i><b>and</b></i> you also have too many login attempts on a new device, or your IP address is unrecognized.</p>
<p>Follow the steps here to finish verifying your login attempt: <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/924-i-can-t-log-in-to-my-buffer-account#2-Confirm-your-login-5oD1C">I can't log in to my Buffer account</a></p>
