<h2 id="h_01GGABZN8YW7TP36FWVYVAKGX7">Buffer browser extension specific troubleshooting</h2>
<p>If you are experiencing issues with the&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/653-buffer-browser-extension" target="_self">Buffer browser extension</a>, we may ask you to try using it in an incognito window. For Chrome and Opera, an extra step is needed to allow this to open.</p>
<p>To allow the browser extension to open in a Chrome incognito window, from the file menu click on&nbsp;<em><strong>More tools</strong></em>&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;<em><strong>Extensions</strong></em>. From there, locate Buffer and click&nbsp;<em><strong>Details</strong></em>. Scroll down and toggle&nbsp;<em><strong>Allow in incognito</strong></em>&nbsp;on.</p>
<p>To allow the browser extension to open in an Opera incognito window, click on&nbsp;<em><strong>Menu</strong></em>&nbsp;&gt;<em><strong>&nbsp;Extensions</strong></em>. From there, locate Buffer and tick the checkbox labelled&nbsp;<em><strong>Allow incognito</strong></em>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01GGABZWHCPHKC4G40F9YP2MSG">How to safelist Buffer in common extensions and ad blockers</h2>
<p>Some extensions, VPN’s or browser settings have been known to sometimes cause issues in Buffer. Because Buffer and these other extensions are updated frequently, you may experience new issues even if everything worked well before.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the extensions listed here don't always cause issues, and you may have a different extension that could be causing trouble. That being said, these are some of the more frequent extensions we’ve encountered and the settings we recommend.</p>
<ul>
 <li>VPN - Most VPN applications should have the option to safelist Buffer.com.</li>
 <li>AdBlock: Turn off a feature called "Fanboy's Annoyances" could allow Buffer to work more smoothly.</li>
 <li>uBlock Origins or Private Badger: Safelist the following rules under "My Filters" tab:
  <ul>
   <li>buffer.com#@#.ss-social</li>
   <li>buffer.com#@##sharer</li>
   <li>@@/ss-social.$domain=buffer.com</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>NoScript: This Firefox add-on could block both buffer.com and the Buffer browser extension. Click on the NoScript add-on icon to "Allow All This Page"</li>
 <li>Ghostery: Add 'buffer.com' to the list of trusted sites.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="h_01GR99WSMRH7YJKZP06KWVXF6H">Tips for using a VPN with Buffer</h2>
<p>Some VPNs will block access to Buffer because of outdated security certificates or other configurations. You can test this by turning off your VPN. If you’re then able to successfully visit Buffer with your VPN turned off, there are some steps you can try within your VPN to enable access:</p>
<ul>
 <li>On some VPNs you can adjust where your traffic is being routed through, in which case we recommend selecting a different country for your traffic origin.</li>
 <li>Within your VPN, safelist buffer.com and *.buffer.com</li>
</ul>
