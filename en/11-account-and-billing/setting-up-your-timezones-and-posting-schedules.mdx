        <p>Your connected social channels each have their <i>own</i> timezone and posting schedule. Every time you added to your posting schedule becomes a time slot in your queue. That way, when you schedule posts, you don't need to think about the date and time each one should be published, as each post will be added to the next available time slot.</p>

<p>Within your <i><b>Preferences, </b></i>you can select a universal timezone for any new channels. Once you set a timezone, any <i>new</i> channel you connect will be set to the timezone you choose.</p>
<p>If you've already connected a channel and want to adjust the timezone, <a href="#Adjusting-your-timezone-by-channel-wKEwJ">jump down to the steps below</a>.</p>
<p>To set a universal timezone:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on your profile avatar at the top right of your Buffer dashboard.</li>
 <li>Choose <i><b>Settings.</b></i></li>
 <li>Click on <i><b>Preferences </b></i>on the left side of the page.</li>

<h2 id="Adjusting-your-timezone-by-channel-wKEwJ">Adjusting your timezone by channel</h2>
<p>If you prefer to have different timezone settings for each channel, you're able to configure the timezone for each of your connected social channels. This allows you to publish content at the most appropriate times for your audiences.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p><b>Note: </b>Timezones are automatically adjusted for Daylight Savings times where this practice is observed.</p>
</div>
<p>You can adjust the timezone and posting schedule for a specific social channel by navigating to the left-hand panel in your Publishing tab and clicking on your desired channel.</p>
<p>Click the settings cog/wheel next to your channel's name and start typing the first few letters of the city you'd like to set it to in the&nbsp;<em><strong>Timezone </strong></em>field. Click the checkmark next to the city when it pops up, and you should be all set!</p>

<div class="callout-red">
 <p>‚ö†Ô∏è The calendar will autodetect your current timezone from your browser, which displays in the top taskbar for reference. If you are scheduling posts on the calendar, please keep in mind that your posts will be added to each social channel's queue according to the timezone that has been set in your Posting Schedule.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/912-setting-posting-goals-in-buffer">posting goals</a>, once you connect a channel to Buffer, you'll be able to set a goal for the number of times you'd like to post per week. You can select between 1x, 3x, 5x per week, or choose a custom goal. Once you've selected your goal, Buffer will populate your posting schedule for you.</p>
<p>For example, if you choose a goal of posting 3x per week, Buffer will create a posting schedule with three time slots across your posting schedule.</p>
<p>In the GIF below, a posting goal of 3x per week is set, so three time slots were created in the posting schedule:</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6863e6478f9e265b36db6e50/file-pteu7tBwk7.gif" alt="GIF of selecting a posting goal in Buffer" style="max-width: 100%; "></p>

<p>If you have an existing posting schedule set up, and you select a posting goal that is higher than your current number of time slots, you'll see the option to <i><b>Add Posting Times to Match Goal. </b></i>By clicking this, we'll add some recommended times to your posting schedule to make sure it matches the posting goal you've set.</p>

<h2 id="FAQ-2gS3J">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Why isn't my preferred timezone listed?</h3>
<p>If your preferred city isn't listed as an option when searching for your timezone, try selecting a major city within your timezone.</p>
<h3>Is there a way to hide time slots from the queue?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can hide time slots from a channel's queue by clicking <i><b>More </b></i>in the upper right corner of the queue. From the dropdown menu, toggle <i><b>Show Time Slots </b></i>to OFF.

<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d191cba97b0c0564c1216d/file-xHVw2qSUOk.gif" alt="GIF of toggling Show Time Slots on and off" style="max-width: 100%; "></p>
<h3>How are time slots in Buffer chosen for each channel?</h3>
<ul>
 <li>If you choose a posting goal, the time slots generated for you are based on our team's research on <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/best-time-to-post-social-media/">the best times to post across each social network</a>.</li>
 <li>If you choose to skip a posting goal, we'll default to default number of posting times per week (14 time slots per week for all channels except X/Twitter and Pinterest, which get 28 slots per week) and generate time slots based on our <a href="https://buffer.com/resources/best-time-to-post-social-media/">best times to post research</a>.</li>
</ul>
