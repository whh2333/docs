 If you‚Äôve forgotten your password or just want to reset it:
</div>
<ul>
 <li>Go to our <a href="https://buffer.com/reset" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Password Reset page</a></li>
 <li>Enter the email address associated with your Buffer account</li>
 <li>Check your inbox for a password reset email from <b>hello@youraccount.buffer.com</b></li>
 <li>Click the link in that email and follow the steps to set a new password</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="I-didnt-receive-the-password-reset-email-fDUmy">I didn‚Äôt receive the password reset email</h2>
<p>If you haven't received the email from us containing the link to reset your password, please be sure to:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Search your email inbox for the subject line: <b>‚ÄúReset your Buffer password.‚Äù</b></li>
 <li>Check your spam folder.</li>
 <li>Think back to see if there is another email address you might have created your account under. For instance, perhaps you entered a company email address, but you signed up under your personal email address.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you still aren't receiving the reset email, please email us at <a href="mailto:hello@buffer.com">hello@buffer.com</a> to get things sorted out. In your message to us, please include the following information to help speed up your request:</p>
<ul>
 <li>If you are on a paid plan, please include the last 4 digits of the credit card we have on file, as well as the expiration date.</li>
 <li>If you are on a Free plan, please include the names and/or links to the social channels you have connected to your Buffer account.</li>

<h1 id="2-Confirm-your-login-5oD1C">Confirm your login</h1>
<div>
 Are you entering the correct email and password but are still seeing a screen asking you to <b>confirm your recent login attempt</b>?&nbsp;
</div>
<p><img src="https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_F986B4B9D1A5B0F13A1F03EC3470BA7BF90A850551E59699BD15A7E8CADB7158_1751299836052_Screenshot+2025-06-30+at+10.10.31AM.png" alt="Image of warning asking to please verify your login" style="max-width: 100%; "></p>
<div>
 To verify your login attempt, you‚Äôll follow these steps:
</div>
<ul>
 <li>Open the email inbox connected to your Buffer account,</li>
 <li>Look for an email from <b>hello@youraccount.buffer.com</b> with the subject line: <b>‚ÄúConfirm your recent login attempt‚Äù</b>,</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
 <li>Open the email and <b>click the button labeled </b><b><i>Login to your account</i></b> ‚Äî <i><u>this step is essential to complete your login</u></i>,</li>
 <li>After clicking the button, you‚Äôll be automatically logged in.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù <b>Notes</b></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Each login attempt sends a new email and invalidates the previous one, so be sure to refresh your inbox and click the button in the most recent email.</li>
  <li>Buffer is asking to confirm your login attempt because you don‚Äôt yet have two-factor authentication set up for your account, <b><i>and</i></b> Buffer has noticed login attempts from different IP addresses. To avoid this in the future, we recommend setting up two-factor authentication by following <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/503-enabling-two-factor-authentication" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">these steps</a>.&nbsp;</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h2 id="I-didnt-receive-the-login-confirmation-email-PP0zP">I didn‚Äôt receive the login confirmation email</h2>
<div>
 If you can‚Äôt find the login confirmation email, you can try the following steps:
</div>
<div>
 1. Check your Spam, Junk, Trash, and any Quarantine folders, as this email can sometimes get caught up in the wrong place. The subject of the email is, "Confirm your recent login attempt‚Äù
</div>
<div>
 2. If you can‚Äôt locate the email, it‚Äôll be helpful to whitelist the following addresses:
</div>
<ul>
 <li>*@buffer.com</li>
 <li>*@youraccount.buffer.com</li>
 <li>cio51677.buffermail.com</li>
 <li>cio51677.buffer.com</li>
 <li>cio51677.youraccount.buffer.com</li>
</ul>
<div>
 3. If you are part of an organization, company, or institution, a next step could be to contact your IT department or email administrator and see if they can locate any emails from Buffer that have been held up in a quarantine or security folder. <b>In many instances, customers with corporate, university, or government emails need to contact their IT team to resolve this. </b>Your IT team or email administrator may also be required to whitelist the above addresses.
</div>
<div>
 After completing these steps, please log in to Buffer again, which will generate a new verification email. This step is required to generate a fresh verification link.
