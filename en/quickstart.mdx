# Quickstart

Getting your documentation site up and running is simple.

## Setup

Create a new repository from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.aitoearn.com). If you donâ€™t already have a docs repo, the onboarding wizard will help you create one.

## Develop

Install the Aitoearn CLI:

```
npm i -g mint
```

Run the preview server in your docs directory:

```
mint dev
```

### Publish your changes

**Install our GitHub App**

Install the Aitoearn GitHub App from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.aitoearn.com/settings/organization/github-app).

After you push to the default branch, your changes will be deployed to production automatically.
