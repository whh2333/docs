<h2 id="h_01HA44RNJZGVJGA8DC27YX9C77">What is a Start Page?</h2>
<p>Start Page is a standalone aspect of Buffer (it <em>is</em> a full-fledged microsite after all!), but you can also schedule posts to it via your Publishing tab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Take a look at a sample Start Page and learn about why your business needs one in this short video, and then follow the steps below to make your own!</p>

<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù Start Page counts as a channel just like any other social channel that you have connected to Buffer. If you are on any of our paid plans, publishing a Start Page means you have to pay for an extra channel. On the Free plan, it counts as one of the 3 channels you can have.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HB78HGKGWYK3JC4KJ4N335RS">Building your Start Page</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Click the blue <i><b>+ New </b></i>button in the top navigation bar and select <i><b>Create a Start Page</b></i>.</li>
 <li>From the "Choose a template" menu, click on one of our pre-designed layouts (you can customize this more later!)</li>
 <li>Give your Start Page a nickname for your own purposes‚Äîcustomers won't see this; it's just for your reference when you're working within Buffer.</li>
 <li>Get creative when customizing! You can add, remove, and edit blocks (including dragging and dropping them to change their order) to set up a website that looks and feels like your company. Add your company's logo and tagline, upload images, add links to your shop and latest blog post, post your latest video content, and link out to all of your social channels.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <h4 id="h_01HAPCXBSF27VWRT9GNWNEEXWE">üìù Notes</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Feel free to create and switch between multiple Start Pages by clicking on the name of your current Start Page in the upper-left corner of your Start Page dashboard.</li>
  <li>At this time, it's only possible to <em>create and edit</em> a Start Page on desktop. However, <em>creating posts for scheduling</em> is available on mobile and desktop.</li>
  <li>Only Buffer users with Admin permissions are able to create and edit that organization's Start Page. Learn more about <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/671-changing-user-permissions-in-your-organization" target="_self">changing user permissions in your organization</a>.</li>
  <li>Start Pages are <strong>deleted</strong> automatically whenever the corresponding Buffer account is deleted.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HAP7PFCV8793E1PV0SRCW88K">Deleting your Start Page</h2>

 <li>Click the three dots to the right of your Start Page.</li>
 <li>Select <i><b>Delete Channel </b></i>from the dropdown list.</li>

<h2 id="How-to-use-a-custom-domain-with-your-Start-Page-_B7E-">How to use a custom domain with your Start Page</h2>
<p>If you‚Äôve purchased a custom domain (e.g. www.[yourname].com), you can point it to your Start Page using domain forwarding or a masked redirect.</p>
<p>To set this up, follow the domain forwarding or redirect instructions from your domain provider. Here are guides from popular registrars:</p>
<ul>
 <li><a href="#" rel="noopener">GoDaddy</a></li>
 <li><a href="#" rel="noopener">Namecheap</a></li>
 <li><a href="#" rel="noopener">Name.com</a></li>
 <li><a href="#" rel="noopener">Dynadot</a></li>
</ul>
<p>If you're using another provider, search their help documentation for terms like "custom domain forwarding", "masked redirect", or "stealth forwarding."</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù A drawback to using masked redirect or domain forwarding is that in can affect your SEO score, as there are now two domains showing the same Start Page content. Although we don‚Äôt have a timeline, we‚Äôre currently looking into other solutions to improve this for you.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="01H85TJYNSEZGDDX8DHJP4BAVJ">Scheduling Start Page posts</h2>
<p>Schedule posts to be published directly to your Start Page! These will appear in your <em><strong>Updates</strong></em> content block. If you forget to add an <em><strong>Updates</strong></em> block, a feed block will be created automatically for you. However, doing it yourself ensures that you get to choose the placement of it.</p>

 <ul>
  <li>Page Views This Week captures traffic from the last seven days, inclusive of today.</li>
  <li>Previously, our Start Page analytics included all traffic, regardless of the source. This sometimes led to inflated page views, as the traffic included numbers for bots and crawlers.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>As of Jan 29, 2024, we‚Äôve added filters to remove traffic from sources like bots and crawlers. This should reflect a more accurate picture of real interactions with your Start Page. The filtered data should reflect on both current and historical analytics.</li>
