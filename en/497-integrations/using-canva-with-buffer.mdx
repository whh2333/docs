 <p>üìù The Canva integration is not yet available in Buffer‚Äôs mobile apps (iOS or Android).</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01FC9FKTZSC1WT2BV63ENHX568">Enabling Buffer‚Äôs Canva integration</h2>
<p>It‚Äôs super easy to get started with Canva in Buffer. In the composer, select your channel(s) and click the small arrow next to our integrations button to select <i><b>Canva</b></i>. If you have a Canva account already, you‚Äôll be set to go! If you don‚Äôt already have a Canva account, however, you‚Äôll be prompted to create an account.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d945a40a7f59feeca85c/file-86OKoQrpgk.png" alt="Alt text: Buffer composer with arrows pointing to the media upload menu and its dropdown options, including Canva, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Unsplash." style="width: 547px; "></p>
<p>Once you‚Äôre logged into Canva, you‚Äôre ready to create designs right there inside of Buffer.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù&nbsp;<em>Not seeing the Canva account you expected?</em>&nbsp;If you have more than one Canva account and the one that Buffer is detecting isn't the one you'd like to work in, open a new tab and head to canva.com. You'll simply logout of the current Canva account and log into the Canva account you'd like to access through Buffer. From there, head back into your Buffer account, refresh, and try to access the Canva integration again.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01FC9FM5CBNQA270Q0ZJFME4QC">Creating a new Canva design within your Buffer composer</h2>
<p>There are two ways you can get started creating a Canva design within Buffer:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Create your Canva design in the Buffer composer to post to multiple social networks at the same time. This is called the Omnibox. When posting from the Omnibox, your design will be square.</li>
 <li>Create Canva designs one-by-one in a size optimized for each social network.</li>
</ul>
<p>We‚Äôll go through both of these below.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù The images you add to posts from Canva have the same file type and size requirements as all images added to your posts. You can view those requirements here:&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/617-ideal-image-sizes-and-formats-for-your-posts" target="_self">Ideal image sizes and formats for your posts</a>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01FC6Y952SQDV4AZ2GC12MF5GB">Creating your Canva design using the Omnibox</h3>
<p>When creating a Canva design within Buffer‚Äôs Omnibox, your image will be 1080px x 1080px. This is a square image size, which is optimized across all networks. ‚ÄúOmnibox‚Äù is just a fancy word for ‚Äúthat first composer you type in prior to opening up your multiple composers where you can tailor each one of your posts separately.‚Äù Below are the steps to get you to the Omnibox.</p>
<ol>
 <li>To open the composer, click the&nbsp;<i><b>+ New&nbsp;</b></i>button in the top navigation bar and select <i><b>Post</b></i>.</li>
 <li>*Select two or more social channels.</li>
 <li>Click the integrations button in the composer and then choose&nbsp;<em><strong>Canva&nbsp;</strong></em>from the menu that appears.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d945a40a7f59feeca85c/file-86OKoQrpgk.png" alt="Alt text: Buffer composer with arrows pointing to the media upload menu and its dropdown options, including Canva, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Unsplash." style="width: 613px; "></p>
<ol start="4">
 <li>You'll be prompted to log into your Canva account if you're not already logged in.</li>
 <li>Create the perfect image for your posts or choose an image from your <em><strong>Projects</strong></em> in Canva, and then click <em><strong>Add to Buffer</strong></em> in the upper right to add the finished image to your Buffer post.</li>
 <li>*Click <em><strong>Customize for each network</strong></em> and fill out your post text for each social network.</li>
 <li>Schedule your post to publish at the date and time of your choice, or choose <i><b>Next Available</b></i> and <i><b>Schedule Post </b></i>to let your posting schedule will do the work for you!</li>

<div class="callout-red">
 <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Images created in Buffer will not be saved in your Canva library for future use, but can be edited within Buffer and used again.</p>
</div>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <h4 id="h_01HBW215D6509BM6JT0M7DSE25">Limitations</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Only PNG files can be uploaded to Canva from Buffer.</li>
  <li>There isn‚Äôt a way to upload multiple images at once.</li>
  <li>The Canva Brand Kit cannot be accessed through Buffer.</li>
  <li>We currently don't support animated video being uploaded via the Buffer/Canva integration. If an animated video is uploaded, it will appear as a photo. Ultimately, this comes down to the type of video file it is. We're not prepared to support animated videos at this time. As a workaround, if you download an animated video from Canva, be sure to export it as an MP4 file. Then head to Buffer and manually upload the MP4 video file. We will be able to publish the video on your behalf since we do support mp4 video files.</li>
  <li>There isn‚Äôt a way to resize your Canva images like you can in Canva. Instead, if using the Omnibox, your image will be 1080 x 1080 (square), and if you end up clicking the <em><strong>Customizing for each social network</strong></em> button before adding in an image, the images will be the size for the social network you created your first image under. You'll find all sizes listed in the bullet point list just below.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01FC6YYDW1AXHJDTY3EA7Y7F07">Creating a Canva design for one social channel</h3>
<p>To create your design for one channel, you‚Äôll follow all of the steps above that don‚Äôt have an asterisk(*) (<a href="#h_01FC6Y952SQDV4AZ2GC12MF5GB" target="_self">here‚Äôs a handy link back up there</a>).</p>
<p>When posting to only one social channel, the size of the Canva template that comes up for you will depend on the social network you‚Äôve chosen.</p>
<p>These are default templates:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Facebook: 940 x 788</li>
 <li>Instagram Post: 1080 x 1350</li>
 <li>Instagram Story: 1080 x 1920</li>
 <li>X/Twitter: 1600 x 900</li>
 <li>LinkedIn: 1200 x 627</li>
 <li>Pinterest: 1000 x 1500</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù If you‚Äôd like to publish the same design in multiple image sizes, we recommend first creating that design within your Canva account, and then hopping into Buffer to customize the template size. We share how to do this step-by-step in the next section.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01FC9FMJ1ASJDMBA78TXQH4A6A">Creating an image in Buffer from one of your saved Canva designs</h2>
<p>If you are a Canva user and already have an image within your Canva library that you‚Äôd like to pull in to use within your Buffer post, you can pull it in right through your Buffer composer (no downloading from Canva and re-uploading to Buffer necessary!)</p>
<p>There are two main benefits to pulling your Canva designs directly through Buffer:</p>
<ul>
 <li>You can make quick edits to your image for the purpose of that specific post. You might edit some text or change the color, for instance.</li>
 <li>Your image will be placed on a template that is optimal for the social network you're posting to (<a href="#h_01FC6YYDW1AXHJDTY3EA7Y7F07" target="_self">the list of sizes can be seen above</a>), which allows you to cater to that social network.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="h_01FC7CW5NJENJ4MM1PVM61BVMX">Accessing your Canva library</h3>
<p>To find images already stored in your Canva library, you‚Äôll follow a few steps.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
 <li>First, click the&nbsp;<i><b>+ New&nbsp;</b></i>button in the top navigation bar and select&nbsp;<i><b>Post</b></i>.</li>
 <li>Click the integrations button in the composer and then choose&nbsp;<em><strong>Canva&nbsp;</strong></em>from the menu that appears.</li>
 <li>Once Canva opens, in the left panel, click <em><strong>Projects.</strong></em>&nbsp;This should bring up all of your projects and folders.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499c45416dd630a4b06b1/img-1711538-1695848896-1255544845.png" alt="Canva interface with an arrow pointing to the Folders tab" style="width: 495px; "></p>
<ol start="4">
 <li>Select the design you‚Äôd like to use.</li>
 <li>Adjust your design to fit the template provided for you (<a href="#h_01FC6Z0E4YYW7JX5PB3MJ4AA2W" target="_self">more on this in the section below</a>). As a reminder, the template provided is the optimal image size for the social network you chose in Step 1 above.</li>
 <li>Insert your image into your post by clicking <em><strong>Add to Buffer </strong></em>in the upper right-hand corner of the Canva editor. Here's a GIF of the entire process.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5da45483d237c76d683e7/file-j8oGBXhZEN.gif" alt="Buffer composer - GIF of process to add Canva image to Buffer" style="max-width: 100%; "></p>
<ol start="7">
 <li>Finish your post text in Buffer and then add your post to the queue. It's now ready to be published at the date and time you scheduled it for.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù If at the same time, you‚Äôd like to use that same design to create an image adjusted to another social network, you‚Äôll want to follow the steps in this section again. Note that in order to ensure the correct template is generated, you‚Äôll want to click the <em><strong>x</strong></em> ("1" in the image below) to remove the image that was copied into that composer from the previous social network design you edited. Then click on the blank image ("2" in the image below) to start back at <a href="#h_01FC7CW5NJENJ4MM1PVM61BVMX" target="_self">Step 1 in this section</a>. Since you‚Äôre using one of your saved Canva designs, the steps should go pretty quickly for you.</p>
 <p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5da6c483d237c76d683ea/file-Qg4ngad6F4.png" alt="Alt text: Buffer composer with a sneaker promo image uploaded and arrows pointing to the uploaded image and the ‚ÄúDrag &amp; drop or select a file‚Äù upload area." style="width: 419px; "></p>
 <p>However, if you'd prefer to only follow these steps once and have all of your images be square, you have two options. First, you can choose Instagram as the social network to create the first image for (since Instagram‚Äôs template is square), and that image will then be added to the composers for all of the other social networks. Or, you can <a href="#h_01FC6Y952SQDV4AZ2GC12MF5GB" target="_self">head back up to the steps at the top of this article and use the Omnibox</a>. If you choose this option, once you hit Step 6 in the Omnibox section, simply click on <em><strong>Projects</strong></em> so that you can access your design of choice.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01FC6Z0E4YYW7JX5PB3MJ4AA2W">Adjusting your Canva design to fit the image size provided by Buffer‚Äôs Canva integration</h3>
<p>Unless the saved Canva design you selected was already the same size as the template provided, you‚Äôll need to reformat your image so that it fits optimally for you.</p>
<p>There isn‚Äôt one way to manually adjust your image to fit into the template provided in Canva. You might choose to simply size it down or up, making just a bigger or smaller version of what you had originally, or you might decide to take this as an opportunity to move things around and completely rethink the design. The creative choice is yours!</p>
<h2 id="h_01FC9FN129VVQECF1WP735JKEQ">Editing the Canva images you created in Buffer</h2>
<p>While you aren‚Äôt able to see the Canva designs you create in Buffer inside your Canva library, you are able to edit those images within Buffer after they‚Äôve been scheduled to your queue and even after they‚Äôve already been published.</p>
<p>Editing your Canva designs within Buffer will allow you to differentiate them before using them again, or it can just give you the opportunity to correct a mistake before it publishes. Let‚Äôs get into how to edit your Canva designs.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HBW215D71GWEYNVWZHG54REV">How to edit a Canva design from your queue before it publishes</h3>
<p>You‚Äôll go through a few steps to edit Canva posts within your queue before they publish to your social channel.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Find the post in your queue and click <em><strong>Edit (pencil icon)</strong></em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c73f6b067e9c553dc832bb/file-bU3nctXbjA.jpg" alt="Pencil icon to edit post" style="width: 648.984px; "></p>

<ol start="3">
 <li>Edit the image in the Canva editor and then click <em><strong>Add to Buffer</strong></em> in the upper right to add the updated image into your Buffer post.</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
 <li>Finally, click <em><strong>Save</strong></em> on your post to save the refreshed version to your queue.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù Even if scheduled to their queues at the same time, each queued Canva image will need to be edited separately within its respective queue. For example, edits made to an image in a Pinterest post will not apply to the same image in the Facebook queue, even if it‚Äôs the exact same image.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HBW215D7FRHSAD1DNM1QXJP6">How to edit a Canva design from your publish dashboard‚Äôs Sent tab</h3>
<p>If you find that you‚Äôd like to send out a similar image to one you previously created within Buffer, you can absolutely do that. Just as with any repeating content, it‚Äôs important that images you send again are edited to look unique and authentic. See our advice in the article, "<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/647-is-it-possible-to-schedule-one-post-to-repeat-multiple-times" target="_self">Is it possible to schedule one post to repeat multiple times?</a>"</p>
<p>To edit a Canva image you previously published through Buffer‚Äôs Canva integration, you‚Äôll follow a few steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>From your publishing dashboard, click on the <em><strong>Sent</strong></em> tab.</li>
 <li>Find the post in your list of sent posts and click <em><strong>Duplicate</strong></em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c73cd765e01777a9334340/file-OLELKUCCjN.jpg" alt="Duplicate option in Sent tab of Buffer" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<ol start="3">
 <li>If you‚Äôd like to share the image to a different social channel than you originally published it to, deselect the current social channel in your composer and select the desired one.</li>
 <li>Click the pencil icon on the image.</li>
 <li>Edit the image in the Canva editor and then click <em><strong>Add to Buffer</strong></em> in the upper right to add the updated image to your post.</li>
 <li>Click <i><b>Schedule Post</b></i>. The post and your refreshed image should now be in your queue!</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <h4 id="h_01HBW215D7QHS8SESK94Q087Y2">üìù Notes</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>It isn‚Äôt possible to adjust an image in Buffer‚Äôs Canva integration unless that image was originally created through Buffer‚Äôs Canva integration. In other words, if you published an image through Buffer for which you did not use the Canva integration, there won't be an edit button on that image.</li>
  <li>You don‚Äôt need any formal design training to use Canva; it‚Äôs made for non-designers. That said, if you‚Äôre looking for some help getting started, Canva offers excellent tutorials in their <a href="https://designschool.canva.com/" target="_blank">design school</a>.</li>

<h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-nYvax">FAQ</h2>
<h3>How do I find the designs saved to my Canva account?</h3>
<p>You'll find your existing Canva designs by clicking into the Canva integration through Buffer and then clicking on either "Folders" &gt; "All your designs" or just "All your designs" on the left-hand side. Read more below:&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.helpscout.net/docs/64cb6d9c0a5b99723c9358af/article/651c7e5c17267470d3915402#h_01FC9FMJ1ASJDMBA78TXQH4A6A">Creating an image in Buffer from one of your saved Canva designs</a></p>
<h3>Why aren't the Canva designs I created within Buffer saved to my Canva account?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, it's not yet available within the Canva API to save your designs to your Canva account. You are able to reuse your designs within your Buffer queue, Sent tab, or Analytics areas, however. Learn how below:&nbsp;<a href="https://secure.helpscout.net/docs/64cb6d9c0a5b99723c9358af/article/651c7e5c17267470d3915402#h_01FC9FN129VVQECF1WP735JKEQ">Editing the Canva images you created in Buffer.</a></p>
