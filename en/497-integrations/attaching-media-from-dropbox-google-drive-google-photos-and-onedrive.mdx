        <p>With easy access to all of your images and videos through integrations with Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, and OneDrive, you can save even more time when posting content through Buffer.</p>
<p>This article contains the following sections:</p>

<h2 id="01FM0H5W21RRAM97D3GGGPK8VC">Authorizing your connection</h2>
<p>Before you can access your images and videos from Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, or OneDrive, you need to complete a simple authorization process.</p>
<div class="callout-red">
 <p>‚ö†Ô∏è Buffer uses Uploadcare to facilitate the integrations with Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, and OneDrive. You‚Äôll see Uploadcare referred to throughout the authorization steps.</p>
 <p>For Buffer organizations with multiple users, each team member can only access the Drive, Dropbox, etc., that they themselves authenticate. For example, a team member wouldn't have access to the organization owner's Drive via UploadCare.</p>
</div>
<ol>
 <li>First, you‚Äôll select which integration you‚Äôd like to authorize. Click the blue<em><strong> + New </strong></em>button at the top of your dashboard to open the composer.</li>
</ol>
<p>Since the process looks very similar regardless of which file-sharing app you choose, let‚Äôs just use Dropbox as an example.</p>
<ol start="2">
 <li>Click <em><strong>Connect to Dropbox</strong></em>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img alt="A pop-up prompting users to confirm that they want to Connect to Dropbox." src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499ca8820396325b6fde9/img-1711538-1695848904-1612054236.png" style="width: 100%; max-width: 100%; "></p>
<ol start="3">
 <li>Next, it will ask you to log in to your account. If your account information is already cached in your browser from a recent session, you might not see this step.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù In OneDrive, it‚Äôs required that Buffer is an approved app within your OAuth apps. To do this, a OneDrive&nbsp;<em><strong>admin</strong></em>&nbsp;can follow&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cloud-app-security/manage-app-permissions" target="_blank">these directions from OneDrive</a>.</p>
</div>

<p><em>*This image shows what this step should look like when authorizing with Dropbox (left), Google Drive (center), and OneDrive (right).</em></p>
<ol start="4">
 <li><p>Once logged in, you‚Äôll authorize Uploadcare to access your files on your behalf. As a reminder, Uploadcare is the integration Buffer uses to provide access to Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, and OneDrive.</p><p>This is what it looks like for Dropbox. It should look similar for Google Drive, Google Photos, and OneDrive.</p></li>
</ol>

<ol start="5">
 <li>Once authorized, you‚Äôre ready to upload images and videos from Dropbox, Google Drive, and/or OneDrive directly into your Buffer posts.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="01GHW24XD8YJM2ES01JYMTA67P">Removing Buffer's access to Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, or OneDrive</h2>
<p>In order to remove Buffer's access via UploadCare to your OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive, you'll need to remove the access directly from the settings of OneDrive, Dropbox, or Google Drive. Here's an example of what this would look like in Google Drive:</p>

 <ul>
  <li>The ability to add media from Canva or Unsplash is not available for Facebook Reels or Instagram Reels.</li>
