<h2 id="h_01HCZSZVY0BCHAQQ25QNG09BXS">Zapier</h2>
<p><a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zapier</a> is a web automation tool, described as the "glue" that connects more than 1,000 web apps. Zaps are workflows, which connect apps so they can work together. Zaps start with a trigger, which is an event in an app which kicks off the workflow, and end with an action, which is an event that's completed automatically in a second app. Zaps automate tasks in the background. Zapier have thousands of templates that you can tweak and use, or you can create your own from scratch.</p>
<p>After signing up for a Zapier account (if you don't already have one), head over to <a href="https://zapier.com/templates/details/a3a2463b18f67097ca5c68222d762255" target="_blank">this template</a>&nbsp;and configure it as needed.</p>
