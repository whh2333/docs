 As of April 2023, Zapier is an official partner of Buffer, opening up new opportunities for users to connect Buffer with a wide range of apps. This partnership allows users to create "Zaps" (automated workflows) that seamlessly connect Buffer with a variety of other apps, enabling a host of actions and triggers to automate your social media management processes.

<p>If you're looking to automatically send posts from RSS feeds to your queue in Buffer, we recommend using Zapier with Buffer!&nbsp;<a href="https://zapier.com/apps/buffer/integrations/rss/141/buffer-new-items-in-an-rss-feed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Here's a direct link to where you can set this up</u></a>. You'll need to create a (free) <a href="https://zapier.com/" target="_blank">Zapier account</a> to do so, then can link your Buffer account to set up this "Zap"/trigger.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù You will need to create multiple versions of this Zap if you'd like posts to be sent to multiple channels.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="Sharing-Media-to-Buffer-via-the-Zapier-Integration-kmgfr">Sharing Media to Buffer via the Zapier Integration</h2>
<div>
 The Zapier integration can be used to pass an image, images for a carousel post, or a video over to Buffer. While this can help you to efficiently create and schedule content, you will need to ensure that the URL you include is a direct link to the media that Zapier is passing along to Buffer.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 Many cloud drives or image hosting services provide ‚Äúshare links‚Äù for the media they host. That said, not all of these share links will allow third-party services to access and download the content automatically. Therefore, regardless of whether a cloud drive or image hosting service is used, you will need to locate and include the direct link for the media within the Zapier integration.
</div>
<div>
 <b>Example:</b>
</div>
<div>
 To illustrate the above, we‚Äôll look at two different types of URLs from Google Drive.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 When attempting share an image or a video from Google Drive, the service will provide a ‚Äúshare link‚Äù similar to the below URL (<i>with the FILEIDHERE</i> portion being the unique id for the media):
</div>
<div>
 <code class="inline-code">https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILEIDHERE/view?usp=sharing</code>
</div>
<div>
 While this URL allows you to share with other users, it doesn‚Äôt provide a direct link to the media for services like Buffer. Instead, you would need to use a link like the following:
</div>
<div>
 <code class="inline-code">https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=FILEIDHERE</code>
</div>
<div>
 The above URL would allow Buffer to directly access the media to include it in the post that is created.
</div>
<div>
 Each cloud drive or image hosting service will have their own types of links for media. Using those will be key to ensuring that your Zap works properly.&nbsp;
