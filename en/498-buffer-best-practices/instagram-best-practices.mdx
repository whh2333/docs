        <p>This guide outlines best practices when it comes to managing Instagram accounts in Buffer. Our top tips include using a unique, authentic, and active Facebook Page for each Instagram business or creator account, avoiding allowing multiple people logging into the Facebook or Instagram accounts that authorized the connection to Buffer, and avoiding logging in and out of multiple Instagram accounts on a frequent basis.</p>

<p>For Facebook and Instagram, it’s best to have only one person access the native social channel. This is the intended use for these platforms, and we’ve seen that when Facebook notices that the account is being accessed from many IP addresses, it sometimes results in a lack of functionality, such as suspensions, errors, and frequent disconnections.</p>
<h2 id="h_c9d55e09-3fdf-4a4f-8cac-33d2f9af5b05">It’s important that each of your social channels is authentic and active</h2>
<p>Along with having an authentic and active Facebook Page connected to each Instagram business account, ensure that each of your Instagram business accounts is also active with real followers, and used for an authentic purpose. If Instagram or Facebook sense unauthentic behavior, they can disconnect your API access without explanation.</p>

<p>Each Instagram account you have should have an email address connected to it, and it should be confirmed. The best way to do this is to check each of your Instagram accounts' settings to make sure there isn't a "Confirm Email" link listed below the email address.</p>
