 <p>üìù It isn't possible to start a trial of our new plans if you're currently subscribed to the Pro, Premium, or Business plan. Feel free to get in touch with us at <a href="mailto:hello@buffer.com">hello@buffer.com</a> if you'd like to learn more.</p>

<p>If you'd like to move ahead with the subscription at the end of your trial, all you need to do is head to the Billing area within your account (<em><strong>Account</strong></em> &gt; <em><strong>Billing</strong></em>) and enter your credit card details under Billing Method. You can also make changes to your plan, along with choosing either the monthly or yearly billing cycle.</p>
<p>If you already have your credit card detail stored in your account, and you'd like to move ahead with the paid plan at the end of your trial, you won't need to do anything at all. Your account will be automatically upgraded at the end of your trial and the first payment will be taken. If you do not wish to upgrade, you will need to head to the Billing area within your account and cancel your trial.</p>
<p>The transition from trial to subscription is seamless and all of your connected social channels, scheduled posts, analytics and reports will remain in place.</p>
<p>If you'd like to move to our Free plan, you can cancel your trial early or we will move you to the Free plan automatically once your trial is completed if you have not entered your credit card details. To end your trial early, you can head to your Billing area within your account (<em><strong>Account</strong></em> &gt; <em><strong>Billing</strong></em>) and choose to cancel the trial.</p>
