        <h2 id="h_01HD29QNYSF0N7WMSQ7NH3PMKS">Receiving important emails about your account</h2>
<p>We try to limit the number of emails we send your way, but there are important messages about your account that we'd love to ensure make it to you. These might include alerts about expired social channels, post failures, failed payments, and new feature advice. These emails will be sent to the account owner. Because of this, it's important to consider who the account owner should be, and which email address is used. We recommend using an email address that is actively monitored, so emails can be handled quickly, as needed. <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/502-changing-your-email-address-or-password" target="_self">Learn how to update your email address here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01HD29QNYSHYDWFD8X08KVQQTQ">Your account runs best when there are fewer than 300 social channels connected</h2>
<p>While it is possible to connect more than 300 social channels to your Buffer account, we find that customers experience best performance and speeds when there are fewer than this connected.</p>
<p>Does that mean that you can't schedule content to more than 300 channels through Buffer? No. What we encourage is that if you manage more than 300 channels, split them across multiple Buffer accounts in order for you to maintain the best performance and speeds.</p>
<p>If you're currently managing more than 300 channels and you're noticing any dips in performance, we'd love to work alongside you to find the right split for your business and help transfer some of your channels from one Buffer account to another.
