<p><i>"Why is this page blank?"</i></p>
<p><i>"It's not working!"</i></p>
<p>—</p>
<p>While our goal is always to keep Buffer running smoothly 100% of the time, incidents and downtime can happen. In the event that Buffer isn't loading, or there's a known issue with a social network's API, we'll <a href="https://status.buffer.com" target="_blank">update our status page</a> with more information to keep you informed about what's happening.</p>
<p>Our status page will include information about the state of the incident—for example, if an incident can be <i>identified, investigating, monitoring, or resolved. </i>We'll also include any known workarounds and a brief description of what feature(s) the incident is impacting.</p>
<p>If you choose to subscribe to our status page, you can either receive updates via SMS or email, so you can be notified when incidents arise and stay up to date as we work to get them resolved.</p>
