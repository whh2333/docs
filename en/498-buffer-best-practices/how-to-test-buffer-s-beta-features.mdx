        <p><a href="https://account.buffer.com/beta" target="_self">Buffer's (free!) Beta Program</a> is a way to test out Buffer's latest features <em>before they launch&nbsp;</em>and share your feedback with our product team as they make final adjustments.</p>
<p>Beta features are still in development and <u><i>aren't fully polished</i></u>. We rely on our Beta community to share glitches they come across so we can quickly fix them up. While we expect most features to make it to production, features can be removed from the Beta Program at anytime (In case you're wondering, "Wait...where'd you go?!")</p>
