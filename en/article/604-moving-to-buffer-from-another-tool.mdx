        <p>Buffer is a powerful, yet robust solution that saves you time and helps you grow your audience.</p>
<p>With Buffer, you can dabble with the best of our features whether youâ€™re on a paid or a free plan. While free tools are less common these days, we prioritize delivering a powerful free plan with enough functionality to get you started. Even on our Free plan, you can organize all of your social media content in advance: connect and manage up to 3 social channels (including the newest channels, like Mastodon and TikTok) and schedule up to 30 posts (10 per channel) for free!</p>
<p>Our mission is grounded in serving small businesses and other ambitious individuals, so if you need something a bit more robust than our Free plan, we have that for you. Our Team plan offers unlimited users, access to a full analytics dashboard, and comment engagement for Instagram and Facebook. Oh, right, and there are&nbsp;<strong>no</strong>&nbsp;contracts to sign!</p>

<p>We don't currently offer ad management (e.g. creating ads, boosting posts, or monitoring ads) or social listening at this time. Although we don't offer bulk scheduling directly within Buffer, we do integrate with <a href="http://Bulk.ly">Bulk.ly</a> and <a href="https://www.bulkbuffer.com/">Bulk Buffer</a> to allow you to import posts via .csv file.</p>
<p>However, our Product team is collecting feedback via our <a href="https://suggestions.buffer.com/" target="_blank">suggestions board</a>&nbsp;and also in the&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.com/community" target="_blank">Buffer Community on Discord</a>&nbsp;if you have something top of mind.</p>
<h2 id="h_01GRMJ6MJ11B9FTKCFGF8W0X95">Using Buffer to bolster your other social efforts</h2>
<p>Most of the users who sign up to Buffer see an increase in their following and engagement. This is because Buffer offers a number of features that help our users boost their engagement and visibility. Here are a few of the ways Buffer helps ðŸ‘‡</p>
