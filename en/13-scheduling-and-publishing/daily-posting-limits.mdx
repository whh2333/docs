        <p>Each social network has their own guidelines on how much content to post. For example, Facebook recommends up to five posts per day, but 35 is really the upper limit they allow without negatively impacting the reach of your posts. The posting limits we have implemented, in accordance with each social network's guidelines, are shown in the table below. These limits <em>don't</em> affect the <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/643-how-many-posts-can-i-schedule-in-advance" target="_self">number of posts you can store in your queue</a> at any one time.</p>
