        <p>It is sometimes necessary to change the order of the posts in your queue. You can do this by dragging and dropping posts into the desired order, or if you feel like really shaking things up, you can use the Shuffle feature to mix up the order of the first 200 posts in your queue.</p>

<h2 id="h_01ERDHCTGGA588KTBKWG0HD722">Reordering posts using drag and drop</h2>
<p>Posts in your queue can be reordered using drag and drop. You can either drag and drop a post on top of another post to swap the order ("drap and swap"!), or you can drag and drop a post into an empty time slot in your queue.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù Please note, it is not possible to move custom scheduled posts using drag and drop, since those posts are locked in place.</p>
</div><br>

<p>The Shuffle feature allows you to mix up the order of the first 200 posts in your queue.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p><b>Note:</b> you can only shuffle posts that are scheduled with the <i><b>Add to Queue</b></i> option. Posts that were scheduled for a custom date and time or posts added by clicking an empty time slot on the queue will not be shuffled since they are locked in place.</p>
</div>
<p>Select the channel on the left hand side of your dashboard that you'd like to shuffle the queue for, click the gear icon next to the channel name.</p>
