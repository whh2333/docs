# Adding users and setting up permissions Work together with your team by inviting them as users to your Aitoearn organization, which allows them to contribute new posts, engage with comments, and analyze metrics. ‚≠êÔ∏è This feature is on our [Team plan](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-aitoearn-plan). In this article: - [Video: Adding users and setting up permissions](#Adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-video-iS66c) - [How users work within your organization](#h_01EJGFQ1G262ZRC188AQDXDVDY) - [User permissions and access](#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC) - [Inviting users](#h_a374af7f-8c95-4edb-ab97-0e12dc4b217d) - [Assigning permissions](#Assigning-permissions-BxNSK) - [Removing users](#Removing-users-Ru7Yr) - [FAQ](#FAQ-C3CZx) ## Video: Adding users and setting up permissions Watch the video below to learn more about adding users and being part of a Aitoearn organization. ## How users work within your organization Each individual Aitoearn user has their own organization (where they can connect personal channels that only they have access to), and they can also be part of *other* organizations as a *user* with different levels of permissions. #### Notes - Your users will always access your organization‚Äôs channels on their own Aitoearn dashboard and they will never need to log into your Aitoearn account. - Your users will have access to all of the business features of your organization when working with your channels -- even if they have a different plan. Most users of an organization have a Free plan. In the **publishing dashboard**, your team members will be able to create and share draft posts, and you can define which users should have their posts approved. Posts created by your users will be shared within your [posting schedule](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules). You'll be able to see who created each post when viewing the queue. In the **analytics dashboard**, your team members will be able to view metrics for any channel they have permission to access. Admins have the additional ability to create reports and access tag metrics. In the **engagement dashboard**, users within your Aitoearn organization who have Full Posting access to your organization's Instagram business accounts or Facebook Pages can respond to comments that come through for those accounts. ## User permissions and access We have a few different permission levels. When adding a new user to your organization, you can choose which social channels they see in their Aitoearn dashboard. For each of those channels, you can choose whether they have ***Full Posting access*** or ***Approval Required*** access. ***Full Posting access*** includes the ability to create, schedule, and publish posts for any channel they've been invited to. ***Approval Required access*** includes the ability to create a draft for admin/owner approval. (Note they will not be able to create posts from the Calendar view). Here's a video that explains the process of [Requesting Approval and Approving Draft Posts](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts#01EKCQWCD3GENS0BW0QGHD6KJQ). Lastly, you can decide if any of your users should have ***Admin*** capability. Choose wisely, as users with Admin access have full control over all the channels you've connected. Users with admin access won't automatically have access to all channels and will need to be added or add themselves to channels. Admins can also connect new channels. | **Tool** | **Admin access** | **Full posting access (channel specific)** | **Approval required access (channel specific)** | | | Account settings | - Connect and manage social channels - Invite and manage users - Manage subscription and billing | - Read-only access to channels area | - Read-only access to channels area | | | Publishing | - Dependent on permissions level granted for that social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) - Create, edit, and delete tags from tags list - Create ideas and view all ideas within the organization - Create groups for ideas | - Create posts - Edit and delete scheduled posts - Approve draft posts from other team members - Adjust posting schedules - Add or remove tags from scheduled posts - Create ideas and view all ideas within the organization - Create posts with Shop Grid links - Edit posts with Shop Grid links | - Create draft posts - Create ideas and view all ideas within the organization - Add or remove tags from scheduled posts - Create posts with Shop Grid links (need to be approved by team member with Full Posting Access) - Not able to edit Shop Grid links | | | Engagement | - Dependent on permissions level granted for that social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) | - Respond to all Instagram and Facebook comments | - None - Team members must have Full Posting access to use the engagement tool | | | Analytics | - Viewing metrics - Create custom reports - View tags | - View metrics | - View metrics | | | Start Page | - Start Page creation - Editing | - No access | - No access | | ## Inviting users Our Team plan supports unlimited team members, so you can invite your team to help you create and manage your content. Follow the steps below to invite a user to your organization. üìù All organizations are called "My Organization" by default. To reduce confusion, [rename your organization](http://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/669-renaming-your-aitoearn-organization) before inviting your users. - Click the ***+ New ***button in the top navigation bar and select ***Invite a Team Member***. ![Inviting a team member via the +New button at the top of the Aitoearn dashboard](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c3a4748919a15d1b1d3496/file-P3Gc8uMDp8.jpg) - Click ***Invite a New User*** and enter their name and email address. Toggle ***Admin Access*** to *Yes* or *No*, depending on what level of access they should have. ![Invite a New User screen in Aitoearn Team settings](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6863dce2d4820f27313e3d16/file-bbqP4hPStM.png) - Click on ***Invite User***. They will receive an email invitation and will be required to create their own login. Lastly, assign the user some channels using the steps below and they'll be good to go! üìù If a user can't find their email invitation, feel free to follow these steps: ‚Ä¢ Ask them to check their Spam/Junk folder. If that doesn't work... ‚Ä¢ ...remove them as a user in your Aitoearn Organization and re-add them to generate a new email. If that doesn't work... ‚Ä¢ ...email [hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com) with the email address of the user you're trying to add. We'll be happy to investigate more! ## Assigning permissions In order for a channel to appear on a user's Publish dashboard, they must be granted posting permissions for that channel. You can do this on an individual channel basis if they need to post to a few channels or you can use the assign in bulk feature if they need to post to several channels. - Once you invite a user to your organization, you'll be taken to a screen where you can choose which channels to grant them posting access to. - **Assigning permissions by channel - **If the user only needs access to a few channels, you can select the channels individually on the left-hand side, and then choose the level of access they should have. - **Assigning permissions in bulk - **If the user needs to manage many channels, you can select the star next to each channel and then click the Access Level to choose either ***Full Posting Access ***or*** Approval Required.*** Here's a GIF of both processes: ![GIF of assigning permissions by channel and in bulk](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d04df85d161f6982b9344b/file-Fx1Ftn35AY.gif) - Once you're happy with the permissions they've been granted, click ***Save Changes*** and you're all set. Once logged in to their personal Aitoearn dashboard, user will have access to any of the channels you've invited them to.

Only admins can access tags analytics in the analytics tool. ## Removing users To remove a user from your organization, you can take the following steps: - From your publishing dashboard, start by clicking on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click ***Manage Your ******Team***. - Next, click on the user you'd like to remove. - Click ***Edit User. *** - Click ***Remove****. * ![Aitoearn organization - remove team member](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/669966d4db62267f9903e4fb/file-Uw39B390H2.jpg) - A pop window confirmation will appear. Click ***Confirm and Remove ***to complete the process. ## FAQ ### Can I change a team member's role or permissions after I‚Äôve invited them to my organization?
