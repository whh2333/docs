If the connection is not refreshed, the application will be unable to publish any scheduled or new posts to that specific channel, and they will fail. <h3>**Will I lose my scheduled posts if I refresh the connection?**</h3> No, refreshing the connection will not delete any of your content that is already scheduled. It only re-authorizes the application to post for you. ### Will Buffer automatically retry my failed posts once I refresh the connection? No, Buffer will not automatically retry your failed posts if the connection fails. Therefore, once you refresh your connection, we recommend retrying any failed posts that you would like to publish.
