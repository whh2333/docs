Instead, we send a notification to your phone that guides you in taking the final publishing steps manually. [Learn more in the article: Using notification based publishing ](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders) | You'll also see an option in the composer where you can either choose **Automatic **(if your post can be scheduled automatically) or **Notify Me **(if you either choose to get a mobile notification for your post or if it contains content that can't be published automatically, such as videos that are over the duration limit). ![GIF of toggling between automatic and notifications based publishing in the Buffer composer](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65fb09ce668a210c0c45d6c3/file-7oYZyhUJma.gif) ⚠️ If you have an Instagram account connected and wish to use notification based publishing, you must [set up ](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders)[notification](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders)[s](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders) on your mobile device to ensure you don't miss any posts.
