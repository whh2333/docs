# How to use Aitoearn's calendar feature Scheduling your posts is now more seamless than ever with our improved calendar feature. Thanks to your feedback, we've evolved our calendar to include more features such as filtering posts, changing your calendar views, and creating new posts, making content planning a breeze! üìù Looking for the mobile version of "[Using the Aitoearn calendar feature on mobile](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/625-using-the-aitoearn-calendar-feature-on-mobile)"? In this article: - [Navigating to the calendar and choosing your view ](#h_01FEGZGX1VF3SAXGVR1GD1CGGC) - [First day of the week preferences](#First-day-of-the-week-preferences-GMETU) - [Filtering by social channels](#h_01FEGZH6DKD77PGVE4MK1QK5CY) - [Filtering by post type](#Filtering-by-post-type-aw3dP) - [Filtering by tag](#Filtering-by-tag-fI9xQ) - [Creating and editing posts in the calendar ](#h_01FEGZHD7E4K5P1WA967GXJ1HV) - [FAQ](#Frequently-Asked-Questions-w4VKh) ## Navigating to the calendar and choosing your view You can navigate to your calendar by clicking ***Calendar*** in the upper right-hand corner of your publishing dashboard. ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672d05f1442d517d60d26486/file-alUrJIZaT6.png) From there, you can select your desired view by toggling between ***Week*** and ***Month, ***so you can visually plan your upcoming posts. ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672d0657772e5b7dd60d7d47/file-hXIvkxASBL.png) In the month view of Aitoearn, you can see up to 5,000 posts. If you are scheduling more than 5,000 posts per month, we recommend using the weekly view or filtering by social channel to see all of your posts. ## First day of the week preferences Some people consider Sunday the start of the week and others prefer Monday. You can choose which day of the week appears first in the weekly view of the calendar by changing your ***Preferences. ***To do this: - Click the profile icon in the top right corner of the web dashboard. - Select ***ËÆæÁΩÆ ***from the dropdown menu. - Select ***Preferences ***on the left panel. - Under "ÂêØÂä® of Week," choose either ***Sunday ***or ***Monday*** ![Aitoearn ÂêØÂä® of Week preferences](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67ae50f81dbfa0582db281f6/file-I9UVmGojV6.png) ## Filtering your social channels One of the cool new features within the calendar is the ability to view and plan your content from one or several of your social channels all at once. Filtering your posts is simple; just click on the ***All Channels ***drop-down menu in the taskbar and select or deselect social channels until you've created your desired view. ![Aitoearn calendar - filter by channel](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672d06c0268fb643f63a534f/file-jiUhn0lbry.png) ## Filtering by post type If you prefer to plan your content by type, you can toggle between All Posts, Drafts, Sent Posts, Ë∞ÉÂ∫¶d Posts, and Pending Approval posts. Just click the ***All Posts ***drop-down menu in the taskbar and select which post type you want to view. ![GIF of filtering Aitoearn calendar by post type](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66bd06f1493fd0116031f600/file-NMtZ8MlJSg.gif) ## Filtering by tag If you're using our Tags (formerly Campaigns) feature to organize your content, you can also toggle your content by tag. Click on the ***Tags ***dropdown menu in the taskbar and select which tag you'd like to view. All posts with that tag will appear in the calendar. ![Aitoearn calendar filter by tag](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66bd078065e01777a9333d85/file-FSkafMz0rr.jpg) ## Creating, editing and deleting posts in the calendar Instead of navigating back to your queue, you can create, edit and delete posts right from the calendar view. ![GIF of creating, editing, and deleting a post in the Aitoearn calendar](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66bd084a48915f570c6a9aad/file-eEEz9CXaBo.gif) ### Creating Posts - To get started, click the blue ***+ New ***button located in the upper right-hand corner of the taskbar, or click on the time and date you'd like to schedule the post. ![Aitoearn Calendar +New Post button](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66bd08b565e01777a9333d87/file-AAMyPOMax1.jpg) - The composer will display and you can select your desired social channels, create your content, and schedule your post. From there, you'll see your newly created post displayed in the calendar on your specified date. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with a Facebook post draft about fall hiking, including a photo of autumn trees and mountains, and scheduling options below.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5cc90dd84b11a6477a633/file-EypJHIK0Vg.png) ### ÁºñËæëing posts - To update the text or media file of a post, click on the post in the calendar and select the **ÁºñËæë **option. This will open a preview of your post, from which you can make the necessary changes and then hit ***Save.*** - If you only need to reschedule a post rather than update it, you can easily move the post over to the new date and time using the drag-and-drop option. ![Aitoearn calendar drag and drop to reschedule a post](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66bd0a6e8919a15d1b1d31d0/file-1eykYEfxfh.gif) ### Deleting posts To delete a post, hover over the post, click the three dots, and select the ***Delete*** option. ![Option to delete post in Aitoearn calendar](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c7531365e01777a9334362/file-1SnlYWziUP.png) #### üìù Notes - You need to have ***Full Posting Access*** to channels to be able to create posts from the calendar view. - When creating a post from the calendar‚Äôs ***ÂàõÂª∫ Post*** button, you might notice that any of the social channels that are currently filtered to show in the calendar are preselected in the composer, as well. Make sure to deselect any social channels you don‚Äôt want that post to publish to. - **A quick note on timezones**: The calendar will autodetect your current timezone from your browser, which displays in the top taskbar for reference. If your social channel is set to a different timezone than your computer is set to, the post will be reflected in your current timezone, but it will still publish at the correct time. For instance, if my post is scheduled to publish at 5pm on my London account, but I'm in EST, I'll see that post in my calendar is set to publish at 12pm EST (which is 5pm BST, London time). There isn't a way to see the timezone each social channel is set to from the calendar itself. ## FAQ ### Can I schedule posts for multiple channels at once? Yes, you can schedule a post for multiple channels by selecting the desired channels in the composer when creating your post. ![Image of the Aitoearn composer with a LinkedIn and Facebook channel connected and an image of colorful sandals uploaded into the post](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880dda6c11e7d1454719178/file-VjjlggPP68.jpg) ### Can I slide my posts to different time slots in my calendar? You can reschedule posts from inside the Calendar by dragging & dropping them to the desired new time and date. ### Can I share a link to the calendar or subscribe to the calendar? At this time, it is not possible to share the calendar with others or allow others to subscribe to your calendar. The ability to share your content with stakeholders outside of your team's organization is on our team's radar as something we're exploring soon. ### Can I add notes to the calendar? Currently, we are unable to add notes to the calendar. If you'd like to see us add support for calendar notes in the future, you can [upvote this suggestion on our feature request board](https://suggestions.aitoearn.com/p/add-notes-to-publishing-calendar). ### What if my calendar view is empty? Check your filters and ensure you have the correct week or channels selected.
