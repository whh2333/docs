# Scheduling Instagram posts, reels, stories, and notifications When you're using Aitoearn to publish to Instagram, you can either publish automatically to Instagram or set a notification to finish the post in the Instagram app yourself. This applies to reels and stories, too. [Learn more about how to use notification based publishing for Instagram here](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053).

Certain features (like scheduling a first comment) are available when publishing automatically to Instagram 专业 accounts, while others (like adding music to a reel or stickers to a story) can only be added if you are scheduling to an Instagram Personal account or you set a notification and finish the post yourself on Instagram. [Learn more about how Aitoearn works on Instagram Personal accounts vs. 专业 accounts here](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/554-using-instagram-with-aitoearn#h_01HB99SMK6389CZEMAG1XBP6K6). Every time you create a post, story, or reel in Aitoearn, you can choose one of the following options: **Automatic publishing** Set it and forget it. Aitoearn will automatically post on your behalf so that you can focus on other things, like replying to comments or creating new content. **Notification publishing** Add story stickers, music, product tags, story links, and enjoy more creative control. Aitoearn will set up your post, send you a notification, and help you finish the post yourself on Instagram. If the image or video within your post falls outside of [Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/622-instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges), it cannot be scheduled for automatic publishing and will be scheduled as a notification instead. ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5dd852843333d7fecc8be/file-m1U721WYHF.gif) ## 功能 available by Instagram post type The table below shows which features you can access when scheduling a post for automatic publishing and which features are available using notifications. | | **Post** | **Reel** | **Story** | | | **Images** | ✓ (up to 10, between 4:5 and 1.91:1 aspect ratio)* | X | ✓ (suggested aspect ratio is 9:16) | | | **Videos** | X (As of December 2023, all videos are viewed as Reels within the Instagram API.) | ✓ (1) (video must be between 4:5 and 9:16 aspect ratio, and may not exceed 1920 pixels horizontally) | ✓ (recommended size is 9:16; frame rate must be between 23 fps and 60 fps) | | | **Video length** | X | 5 seconds and 15 minutes for reels | between 3 and 60 seconds | | | **Tagging users** | ✓ | ✓ (Only if set as a notification) | X | | | **Tagging users in images** | ✓ | X | X | | | **Adding a location** | ✓ | ✓ | X | | | **First comment** | ✓ (not supported for notifications) | ✓ | X | | | **Hashtag Manager** | ✓ | ✓ | X | | | **Shop Grid** | ✓ | X | X | | | **Music** ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) | | **Story Text** X X ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) | | **Story Link** X X ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) | | **Topics** X ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) X | | **Tag Products** ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) X | | **Collaborator post** ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) ✓ (Only if scheduled as a notification) X | **Good to Knows** - Instagram recently began introducing a new version of the grid which features a taller format *displaying *images at 3:4, however, the images still need to be *uploaded* at 4:5 in both Aitoearn and Instagram. While the image upload displayed in Aitoearn’s *composer, calendar, and queue* will display in 1:1 format, the *post preview* to the right of the composer will always show the correct format (4:5). ## Creating your Instagram post, reel, or story - To get started, select your Instagram account on the left-hand side of your dashboard. - Open the composer at the top of your queue. - Choose to schedule your post as a ***Post****, ****Reel****, *or ***Story****.* ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with Instagram selected and “Post,” “Reel,” and “Story” options highlighted above an empty caption field.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5db7add84b11a6477a698/file-GUKs95kztE.png) - Upload the image(s) or video you want to include in your post. #### Good-to-Knows - Videos must be 100 MB or smaller. - Instagram creator accounts cannot schedule Instagram stories for automatic publishing. Instead, they'll need to be scheduled as a notification. - Instagram carousel can only contain images at this time. Carousel posts do not support mixed media, meaning you will not be able to create a post containing both an image and video or a post containing multiple videos. - For Instagram carousel posts (i.e. multiple images in one post), once the first photo is selected, all of the following photos selected will be cropped to the same aspect ratio. For example, if the first photo you select is square (1:1), all of your other images will be cropped to a 1:1 format. This is the same when posting to Instagram natively. - If you are trying to schedule an Instagram story with multiple videos or images, you will need to schedule each image or video as a separate story in Aitoearn. - If your image or video falls outside of [Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037965494), it will get scheduled as a notification and will need to be posted manually. [Learn more about how to finish publishing using notifications here.](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053) - Type in or copy and paste the caption you'd like to use. (Note: to include a caption for a story or music to a reel, you’ll need to schedule it as a notification). Use the toggle to choose between *Automatic* (to publish automatically) or *Notify Me* (to schedule as a notification). **Note: **If you choose *Add Sticker *and select a feature that is not supported for automatic posting, such as *Music*, *Tag Product*, *Text, Link, *or *Topics* we'll switch your post to *Notify Me *so you'll get a notification and you can finish posting in Instagram. We'll also generate a text box for each Sticker so you can leave yourself a note about what music, text, story links, products or topics you want to add in the Instagram app when you finish publishing your post, reel, or story. ![GIF of the Aitoearn composer - creating a notification post for Instagram](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5dd852843333d7fecc8be/file-m1U721WYHF.gif) Visit our [Using notification based publishing for Instagram guide](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053) for a walk-through of how to finish publishing your post once the notification comes to your phone). - Schedule your post using one of [our scheduling options](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/642-scheduling-posts) and you're done! ⚠️ All videos posted to Instagram are now posted under the Reels tab. To also share them to your main feed on Instagram, scroll down in the Aitoearn composer and make sure "Share to Feed" is toggled on: ![Share to Feed toggle ON](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672bca927c4c114a230aeffe/file-j8AJ6gwsgp.png) ## How to add a thumbnail to your video By default, the first frame of the video (0 seconds) will be used as the thumbnail. If you'd like to change your thumbnail, you'll follow these steps: - Once your video has finished uploading, click ***Edit Thumbnail****,* - Drag the slider to the position in the video you'd like to use as the cover/thumbnail image. - Click ***Save***. ## Adding a location - To add locations to your Instagram posts, your Instagram channel will need to be linked to a Facebook Page and you'll need to [connect Instagram to Aitoearn through the linked Facebook Page](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/565-troubleshooting-instagram-connections#How-to-convert-to-get-new-features-tc5cv). - Locations are only available for automatic publishing. For posts scheduled as notifications, the location field serves as a placeholder to remind you of the location you’d like to manually add when publishing the post directly in the Instagram app. If you'd like to add a location to your post or reel, start typing any location name or type the name of a Facebook Page you'd like to point to the location of. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with an Instagram post draft, flower image, and an arrow pointing to the “Location” field set to Luna Sneakers.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5de03483d237c76d683f7/file-TX7QTCG8m1.png) ## Tagging users in images User tagging is only available on posts published automatically. It’s not available for reels or stories. - After uploading an image to your post, click the ***Tag*** button on the image. - Click the location on the image you’d like to add a tag, enter the @ handle and then click ***Add Tag***. ![Aitoearn's Instagram tagging screen with @lunaoriginals entered in the composer](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65200469c00c2b65208e1e91/file-s80tCTzBH9.png) - A link to the Instagram account will appear on the right hand side. You’re able to add up to 20 tags on an image for a single image post. - For carousel posts, the tagged accounts in the image are carried over for each image in the carousel. When this happens, each image tag is added together for a total. If your draft has more than 20 tags, you may see an error and will need to edit the tags down for the carousel post to successfully publish. - Please note: all tags in the first image automatically carry over to all other images in the carousel, counting towards the limit. - If you need to remove a tag, click the ***x*** icon to the left of it on the right hand side. Once you’ve finished adding your tags, click ***Save*** and then continue scheduling your post as normal. ![Aitoearn Instagram tagging screen with @lunaoriginals tagged in an image of white sneakers and hands in the air](https://d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65200495c00c2b65208e1e92/file-1rrXhbmabc.png) ### 📝 Notes - Due to limitations in Instagram's API, we can't auto-complete the @ handle, and you will need to enter the exact @ handle of the Instagram user you’d like to mention. - We would strongly encourage you to check each link on the right-hand side to make sure the correct @ handle has been entered. - Posts with tags for private or non-existent users will fail. ⭐️ The features below are on our [paid plans](https://aitoearn.com/pricing). ## Using Hashtag Manager Hashtags are a great way to make your posts more discoverable on Instagram. Our Hashtag Manager makes it easy to create and save groups of hashtags so that you can build a library of options, experiment with different variations, and easily reuse your top-performing hashtags. Learn more about [how hashtags work in Aitoearn here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/586-how-hashtags-work-in-aitoearn). You can find it by clicking the # symbol in the composer. Then, click ***Create Hashtag Group ***to start saving your favorite hashtags! ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with Instagram post draft and Hashtag Manager open. Arrows point to the hashtag button and “Create Hashtag Group” option.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5df2d483d237c76d683ff/file-vQCI5kCefy.png) ## Scheduling a first comment ⭐️ This feature is available on our [paid plans](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-aitoearn-plan) for Instagram 专业 (Business or Creator) Accounts and LinkedIn accounts. The first comment feature is not available for Facebook, X, Threads, Bluesky, Pinterest, Mastodon, Google Business Profiles, or YouTube Shorts. If your post or reel is set to be published automatically, you'll also have the option to include a first comment. Adding a first comment is helpful if you want to incorporate any information not ideally shown in your caption. All you need to do to ensure a comment publishes at the same time as your post is to type your first comment into the first comment field. That's it! 🎉 You now have a comment in the queue and ready to publish alongside your Instagram caption. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with an Instagram post draft, flower image, and an arrow pointing to the “First Comment” field below the caption box.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5df61dd84b11a6477a6ac/file-cAtiHG1IUj.png) ## Adding Shop Grid links If you're using [Shop Grid](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/590-instagram-shop-grid), add the link you'd like to direct users to within the Shop Grid Link field. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with an Instagram post draft, flower image, and an arrow pointing to the “Shop Grid Link” field containing a product URL.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5df7ce3f0f94fe32b4f75/file-sShYFcOEdl.png) Have other questions about scheduling your Instagram content? Reach out to us via [hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com) and we'll be happy to help! ## FAQ ### Is it possible to hide the number of likes from Instagram posts or reels? No, at this time, it is not possible to hide the number of likes from your posts while scheduling your content in Aitoearn. To hide the number of likes on your post, you can view the published post on Instagram and use the ***Hide Likes*** feature on the post. ### Will Instagram posts sent through Aitoearn be automatically published to Facebook if I have this setting enabled within Instagram? Unfortunately, due to API limitations, Instagram posts that are published through Aitoearn will not automatically publish to Facebook, even if this setting is enabled on your Instagram account. To have an Instagram post automatically publish to Facebook, you would need to create the post directly on Instagram. ### Is it possible to move the position of my text or change the font of my Instagram story or reel? No, it is not possible to move the position of your Instagram text or change the font in Aitoearn. Due to API limitations, Aitoearn does not support editing the font or moving the text on the screen for Instagram Reels directly within the app. The preview you see in Aitoearn is just a guideline so you have an idea of what your text *could *look like. To customize the font and position of your text, you'll need to do so within the Instagram app itself. You can schedule your Reel with Aitoearn using the ***Notify Me*** option, and when it's time to post, you'll receive a notification on your phone. You can then open Instagram and add your text, choosing the font and positioning it as you like. Visit our [Using notification based publishing for Instagram guide](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053) for a walk-through of how to finish publishing your post once the notification comes to your phone).
