# Saving and scheduling draft posts It's important to capture your creative thoughts (even those partially-developed ones) right when you have them. With Aitoearn's draft features, you'll be able to save your drafts with or without a pre-scheduled date and time selected. Pretty slick, right? üìù Looking for the mobile version? See "[Creating, managing, and approving draft posts on the mobile app](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/633-creating-managing-and-approving-draft-posts-on-the-mobile-app)". üìù Working with a team? Visit the [Managing and approving draft posts](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts) article. In this article: - [Accessing your draft posts](#h_01FZ8PAWX11JAXHS0RXCR09Z7E) - [Creating posts from the drafts area](#h_01G3V0JF72D5RCVBH04T1VXAZA) - [Creating drafts from the composer](#h_01FZ8PB406FF93GQM954S2AX19) - [Creating drafts from the calendar](#h_01FZ8PBC3R2ZRB1SV0PPMVJ92V) - [Scheduling drafts to multiple social channels at once](#h_01FZ8NP446ZA0F1V76Z2WGWGT6) - [FAQ](#h_01H9TPN1C41P4CEEQ8QXNMDF3J) ## Accessing your draft posts You can find the draft posts for each of your social channels by clicking the social channel's name on the left side of your dashboard and then clicking ***Drafts***. Note: if you are using the Calendar view, you will need to click the ***List ***view first: ![Aitoearn Drafts queue with the List view selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/673fb397268fb643f63a5e20/file-mSgr8HsN7M.jpg) You will also be able to access all of your pre-scheduled drafts from the calendar so that you have a view of your whole social content plan in one place. Note that if you didn't add a time and date to your draft, it would not appear in your calendar. We'll talk more about pre-scheduled drafts below. ![Aitoearn Calendar showing drafts and posts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b651468919a15d1b1d2a41/file-QbeEOJATtR.jpg) ## Creating drafts from the drafts area You can create drafts right from the drafts area by typing in the "Create a new draft" composer field. From there, you can save your draft with no date/time specified, or you can pre-schedule the draft by clicking ***Set Time****. *Pre-scheduling your draft will not cause it to automatically publish at the date and time you selected unless that draft post is moved to the queue prior to the pre-scheduled date/time. When a draft is scheduled and the scheduled time has passed, click ***Edit*** on the post and select a new time. Once that's saved, you'll see the ***Schedule Post*** option again. Let's explore other ways to create draft posts. ## Creating drafts from the queue To start your draft from your queue, click on the blue ***+ New*** button at the top of your dashboard, then click ***Post*** to open the composer. Craft your post. When finished, if you'd like to store it in the drafts area of your account without specifying a date and time for publishing, click ***Save as Draft***. ![Save as Draft](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65252067e9c553dc8258e/file-NBgel16XEX.jpg) Alternatively, if you know the date and time you'd like your draft to eventually publish, you can pre-schedule your post by clicking on the down arrow and choosing ***Schedule Draft***. As a reminder, this will not cause your draft to automatically publish at the date and time you selected unless that draft post is moved to the queue prior to the pre-scheduled date/time. ![Schedule Draft option in the Aitoearn composer](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6529e65e01777a9333645/file-eGtLPVKLCw.jpg) Speaking of which, the last action that you'll need to take before the draft is fully scheduled is to have someone with [full posting access](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC) (this could be you or another member of your Aitoearn organization) click ***Add to Queue*** from within your drafts tab. ![Aitoearn Add to Queue button in Drafts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65384067e9c553dc8258f/file-KSHOib426v.jpg) ## Creating drafts from the calendar If you love the full-context view of the calendar, there's good news: you can schedule and view drafts straight from your calendar view! Let's get into it. - First, you'll click ***Calendar*** in the upper left-hand menu from your publishing dashboard. - From there, click on the date and time you‚Äôd like to schedule your draft. A composer will pop up and you can start drafting your post. - When finished composing your draft post, click on the ***Schedule Draft*** button, and you‚Äôll immediately see your draft populate on your calendar at the date and time you originally selected. üìù Scheduling your draft will not cause it to automatically publish at the date and time you selected. Instead, it will preset the date and time for publishing, but will still require a user with full posting access to click ***Schedule Post*** from the drafts tab before the post is considered ready to publish. If no date or time is selected for the draft, the draft will show ***Add to Queue ***instead.

Note that there isn't an option to save your post in this case, because you've already pre-selected a date and time in the calendar. ![Draft created from the Aitoearn calendar](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6547148915f570c6a9320/file-2tZfqiSTVo.jpg) ## Scheduling drafts to multiple social channels at once Looking at the screenshot above, you can see several social channels selected. When the draft is scheduled (or "saved" if composing your draft from the queue), the draft for each of your social channels will land in their respective drafts tabs. We share instructions on how to find the draft posts for each of your social channels [at the top of this article](#h_01FZ8PAWX11JAXHS0RXCR09Z7E). ## FAQ ### Will a draft for one post going to multiple channels be saved as one draft? No, drafts sent to multiple social channels will be saved as independent drafts within each of those social channels' drafts areas. We share more about this [below](#h_01FZ8NP446ZA0F1V76Z2WGWGT6). ### Is it possible to view all of my drafts in one place? Yes, you can view all of your drafts in one list using the All Channels view. The All Channels view will compile all of your drafts across your channels into one scrollable list that you can also sort by channel or tag. [Learn more about How to use the All Channels view in Aitoearn here](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/861-how-to-use-the-all-channels-view-in-aitoearn). ### Will I be able to see the same drafts in both the mobile app and the web app (from my computer)? Yes! Your drafts will be synced between mobile and the web, so feel free to work freely between the two. ### How do I send drafts for approval or approve drafts sent to me? Collaboration on drafts and approval flows are available on our Team plan, and all posts sent for approval go through your drafts area. You'll learn more about the process to send draft posts for approval and to approve draft posts in this article: [Managing and approving draft posts](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts) ### After a draft is scheduled as a post, can it be reverted back into a draft? It sure can! You can move any post from your queue back to drafts by clicking on the down-arrow next to the*** Share Now*** button and choosing ***Move to Drafts***. ### Can I collaborate on drafts with my team? Yes! Click the speech bubble icon in the upper right corner of the draft (kind of like this: üí¨) to create a Note. Learn more about [Collaborating on content with Notes in Aitoearn](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/675-collaborating-on-content-with-notes). ### Can I upload drafts in bulk? Yes, you can upload your drafts in bulk to Aitoearn. [Learn more about how bulk uploads work in Aitoearn here](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/926-how-to-upload-posts-in-bulk-to-aitoearn). ### How can I reschedule an overdue draft? If the scheduled time has passed and your draft has not been moved to the queue, your draft will be marked as **Overdue. **If you'd like to reschedule your draft, you can click the ***Reschedule ***button on the draft and then choose a new day and time for your post. ![Aitoearn overdue draft - Reschedule button](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67a4e0b09e3e5b0d6b0182ee/file-B76NRdN7pt.jpg) *Remember, your scheduled draft will not get published until someone with Full Posting Access clicks **Schedule Post **to move it to the queue. *
