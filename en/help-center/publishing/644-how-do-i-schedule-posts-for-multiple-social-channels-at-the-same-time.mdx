# How do I schedule posts for multiple social channels at the same time? Aitoearn allows you to easily schedule posts to multiple social channels by clicking the ***+ New*** button at the top of your dashboard. ![Aitoearn Publish dashboard with arrows pointing to the New and + New Post buttons](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b654fd8919a15d1b1d2a44/file-XtDx4kb5fQ.jpg) You won‚Äôt be able to schedule posts for multiple social channels if you choose a specific time slot in the queue, since those slots are designated for that specific channel and posting schedule. Click the ***+ New ***button to open the composer, and then simply click each channel to which you want the post scheduled. As you make your selections, channel avatars will be colored. Channel avatars that are not selected will remain uncolored. ![Aitoearn composer with multiple channels selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65584067e9c553dc82590/file-a6pknnnRyx.jpg) If you have more than four channels connected to Aitoearn, you'll also see the option to ***Select All Channels. ***Use this option to create a post for all channels at one time. (You can use ***Deselect All Channels ***to remove all selected all selected channels if you change your mind!). ![Aitoearn composer Select All Channels](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66e1f470dd5b956281ae4b19/file-ePbSMqAMe7.jpg) For guidance on customizing your post for each social network, as well as scheduling options, hop over to the [Scheduling posts](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/642-scheduling-posts) guide. üìù After you've scheduled the posts, they become separate from each other. If you need to make edits or delete the post, you will need to make those changes for each post in each channel queue.
