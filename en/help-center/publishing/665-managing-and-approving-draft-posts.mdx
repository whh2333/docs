Account owners and users with ***Full Posting Access*** are able to edit, delete, and move *all* drafts to the queue. Users with ***Approval Required Access*** are only able to edit, delete, and request approval on *their* *own* drafts. ### Video: Requesting approval on a draft Watch the video below to learn more about how to manage and approve draft posts. ### Requesting approval on a draft As a user with Approval Required Access, you will need to request approval on your draft once you're happy with it. To do so, simply click ***Request Approval*** and your draft will be moved to the "Approvals" tab. üìù If you are the account owner or a user with Full Posting Access, you will not have the option to request approval on your drafts. The option to Request Approval will appear in a few places: You'll see the option to *Save and Request Approval* in the composer: ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with a Facebook post asking about favorite fall sports, and an arrow pointing to the ‚ÄúSave and Request Approval‚Äù button.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d299d0d3bb0cf2ad6d1e/file-AtXOgWaoGo.png) - Or if you've chosen to ***Save Draft, ***you can always choose ***Request Approval ***later by heading to the **Drafts **tab and finding your draft that you want to submit for approval: ![Aitoearn Drafts queue with an arrow pointing to the Request Approval option on a draft](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c64dc36eb51e63b8f9f45d/file-PxAMc5eQ7T.jpg) ### Reverting approval on a draft If you've already requested approval but want to keep working on your draft, you can move it back to the drafts list by clicking ***Revert Approval Request. *** ![Revert Approval Request](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c6484265e01777a933427e/file-MoscbZLWLA.jpg) ### Adding a draft to the queue As the account owner or a user with Full Posting Access, you can move any draft from the drafts list to the queue even if the user who created the draft has not yet requested approval. If you're ready to schedule the post, you should see one of two options: - Clicking ***Add to Queue*** means no day and time was selected, so it will get added to the next available queue slot. - Clicking ***Schedule Post ***means it has a pre-set day and time and will be scheduled at the date and time it was pre-scheduled for. If a user with Approval Required Access has *already* requested approval on a post, it will appear in the ***Approvals*** tab. Account owners and users with Full Posting Access can review and approve posts there. ![Aitoearn Drafts queue with one draft showing the option to Add to Queue and one draft showing the Schedule Post option](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c7374265e01777a9334333/file-vA0zhkdStw.jpg) ### Editing or deleting a draft If you want to make modifications to a draft, click ***Edit***, make any changes you like and then click ***Save Draft***. Likewise, if you'd like to remove a draft completely, click ***Delete*** and then ***Confirm***. Remember, the account owner and users with Full Posting Access can edit any drafts, while users with Approval Required Access can only edit their own. ## Managing approvals Feel free to watch the video above, which shows the process for users to request approval on a draft post, as well as the process to approve posts: [Requesting Approval and Approving Draft Posts](#01EKCQWCD3GENS0BW0QGHD6KJQ) Draft posts that users with Approval Required Access have requested approval on will appear in the Awaiting Approval tab, where both the account owner and users with Full Posting Access are able to review and approve them. üìù If you'd like to receive an email when a new draft is ready to review, click your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard, followed by ***My Preferences***. From there, select the ***Notifications*** tab and toggle the "Collaboration" notification to ***Enabled***. ### Editing and approving draft posts in the Approvals area If you'd like to make modifications to a draft post in the Approvals area, click ***Edit***, make any changes you'd like, and then click ***Save Draft***. When the post is ready, simply click the ***Approve*** button on the post. - If you see ***Add to Queue, ***it means the post doesn't have a pre-set day and time, so it'll get added to the next available timeslot. - If you see ***Schedule Post***, there's a day and time set, so it'll get scheduled for the day and time it was pre-scheduled for. ![Add to Queue and Schedule Posts buttons in the Approvals tab](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68016630bccef432b1ebefcd/file-BcT86CIGQH.jpg) ### Moving a draft post back to the drafts list If you'd like to move the post back to the drafts list so that the user can continue to work on it, click ***Move to Drafts***, and the user who created the post will receive an email notification as long as they have their "Collaboration" notifications set to enabled. ### Deleting a draft post If you'd like to remove the post completely, click ***Delete*** and then ***Confirm***. ## FAQ ### Is it possible to see a list of all posts awaiting approval? Can I approve all of my organization's drafts in one place? Yes, by using our All Channels view, you can access a list of all of your posts that are awaiting approval, making the approvals process super easy and efficient.
