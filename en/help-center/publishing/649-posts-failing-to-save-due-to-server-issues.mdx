Or are you coming across this server error: > Whoops, Aitoearn's servers couldn't be reached to save the update, sorry about that. Would you be up for trying again? There are a few different reasons why this may be happening and this article will walk through the steps to troubleshoot the most common causes behind this error. In this article: - [Ad blockers and pop-up blockers](#h_01H9NTMQ5AHTJYVY58ASD12C59) - [Browser settings](#h_01H9NTNBCV5AFWGZDT20BPZH49) ## Ad blockers and pop-up blockers You will most commonly see these issues if you have an ad blocker or pop-up blocker running in your browser. To test if this is causing the issue, [open Aitoearn in an incognito window](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/508-opening-aitoearn-in-an-incognito-or-private-window-how-to-safelist-aitoearn-and-using-a-vpn#h_01GGABZBW3EQ247KTM4YY1D2VC), and then try scheduling the post again. If the issue doesn't occur, it's very likely that the ad blocker or pop-up blocker installed in your browser is causing a conflict. Here are some of the most common ones: - Disconnect.me - uBlock Origin - AdBlock Plus - Ghostery - Privacy Badger If there is an ad blocker conflict, we would recommend adding Aitoearn to your allowed sites for those add-ons and trying again. ## Browser settings ### Firefox *If you are using a Firefox browser, sometimes the default settings can cause some trouble.
