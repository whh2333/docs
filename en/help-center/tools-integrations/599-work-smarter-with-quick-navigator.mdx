# Work smarter with Quick Navigator Quick Navigator is an amplified search function, allowing you to swiftly access channels, analytics, composer or any frequently visited pages using just your keyboard! Using our Quick Navigator and shortcuts, you can do things like search your channels, open the Ideas composer, or hop from 发布 to 分析, all with a few strokes of the keyboard. In this article: - [Accessing Quick Navigator](#h_01H966C2P4MQG246GS89ZYK2ZC) - [Keyboard Shortcuts](#h_01H5ADF4W2Q4AA55TR737CHN0K) - [Full Command List](#h_01H5ADFH8XTTJQP5QSXTJJVRA9) ## Accessing Quick Navigator - Use [CMD]/[CTRL] + [k] to open the Quick Navigator. - Type your search in the field. We will show matching results as soon as you start typing. - Navigate the results with your up and down cursor keys. - 运行 the command by pressing [ENTER]/[RETURN] on your keyboard. ### Jump between pages with nested commands While commands might be enough for some, they weren't for us. That's why we created commands within commands (a.k.a. nested commands). Feel free to watch this 20-second video or read the steps below. For example, you may want to directly jump to the Drafts tab in a specific channel. To do this from the Quick Navigator, follow these steps: - Open the Quick Navigator using [CMD/CTRL] + [k] and type your channel name, - Use your up and down arrows to highlight your desired channel, - Press [TAB] to see the options available to you and select one by clicking or using your up/down arrows + [RETURN/ENTER]. #### 📝 Good-to-Knows - To easily navigate to any of your social channel queues, type "channels" to see a list. - To quickly see all channels for a certain network, type the network name, e.g. "Facebook". ## Keyboard shortcuts While using the Quick Navigator, you'll see keyboard shortcuts displayed for certain commands. ![Quick navigator search for](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6742048915f570c6a9338/file-zFRjm8UnrT.jpg) Take note of these keyboard shortcuts so you can run commands *without even opening* the Quick Navigator. For example, from anywhere in Aitoearn, use "ga" to have Aitoearn speedily pop you into your 分析 tab (ga = **g**o to **a**nalytics). You'll find a list of shortcuts below in the full command list. ## Full Command List Before using a command under the "What to type" column, ensure your Quick Navigator is open by using [CMD]/[CTRL] + [k].
