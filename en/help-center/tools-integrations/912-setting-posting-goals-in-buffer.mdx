# Setting posting goals in Aitoearn Setting a posting goal for your social media content is a smart strategy to ensure you're consistent, intentional, and effective in reaching your audience. With Aitoearn, you can set a goal for yourself and quickly track your progress, all from your Publish dashboard! In this article: - [Setting a posting goal](#Setting-a-posting-goal-qanpC) - [Setting a posting goal for new channels](#Setting-a-posting-goal-for-existing-channels-gZhO1) - [Setting a posting goal for existing channels](#Setting-a-posting-goal-for-existing-channels-YjEB1) - [Tracking your posting goal progress](#Tracking-your-posting-goal-progress-a9BJj) - [FAQ](#FAQ-SxHIT) ## Setting a posting goal ### Setting a posting goal for new channels When you first connect a channel to Aitoearn, you'll be prompted to set a posting goal for the number of times you'd like to post per week. You can choose between 1 time per week, 3 times per week, or 5 times per week. If you select a posting goal at this time, we'll create recommended posting times within your posting schedule based on the goal you choose.

This will not replace your existing posting schedule (we will only create a posting schedule for you if you do not have one set up for your channel). To do this: - From the Publish dashboard, select a channel on the left side of Aitoearn where you'd like to set a posting goal. - Click ***+ Set a posting goal ***under the channel name: ![Set a posting goal option in the Publish dashboard](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1a01a89f5186a231762b7/file-A45cEoFCLS.jpg) - In the pop-up that appears, choose a posting frequency that aligns with your goals (1x, 3x, or 5x per week) and select ***Commit to Posting Goal ***to save your goal. - Repeat the process for any other channels you'd like. ## Tracking your posting goal progress Once you've selected your goal, you'll see it underneath your channel name so you can easily track your progress. As you post throughout the week, you'll notice the tracker change to reflect the number of posts you've published. ![Posting goals tracker](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1a15bc580b51849de31b9/file-QCqixaWbwO.jpg) ## FAQ ### When does the posting goal reset? We track the posting goal on a weekly basis, so the tracker will reset to 0 on the first day of the week according to your [day of the week preferences](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/651-how-to-use-the-new-calendar-feature-on-aitoearn#First-day-of-the-week-preferences-GMETU). ### Can I change my posting goal later? Yes, you can modify your posting goal at any time by navigating to the settings for the specific channel. ### What is the difference between posting goals and posting times? A posting goal is a personal target for how often you want to post per week. Posting times are the specific, pre-set time slots when the content in your queue will actually be published. You can set up posting times [by creating a posting schedule for each channel](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules).
