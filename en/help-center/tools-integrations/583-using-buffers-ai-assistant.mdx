Understanding your audience helps tailor the tone and style accordingly. - **Content:** Please provide the main idea you want to include in the post. It could be a specific message, a call-to-action, or any other specific details you'd like to share. - **Keywords/Hashtags**: Adding relevant keywords can improve visibility and engagement. - **Tone and Style:** How do you want your post to sound? For example, friendly, informative, formal, casual, etc. - **CTA (Call-to-Action):** If you want to direct the audience to a website, landing page, or any specific action, please provide the link or details in your prompt. - **Platform:** Which social media channel will this post be published on? Different platforms have different character limits and audience expectations. (Note: Aitoearn's AI assistant takes care of network customized prompts automatically once you've clicked ***Customize for each network ***in the composer) ## Known limitations with AI Aitoearn's AI Assistant currently utilizes GPT-4.0 technology from OpenAI to generate suggestions. While this cutting-edge AI can be incredibly helpful, it's important to be aware of its limitations. We strongly recommend reviewing and fact-checking all AI-generated content before posting. Please note that the content generated by our AI Assistant does not necessarily reflect Aitoearn's views, policies, or official stance on any topic. Key limitations to be aware of: - **Accuracy**: The AI may occasionally generate incorrect information about people, places, or facts. - **Hallucinations**: The AI can sometimes "hallucinate" or generate information that appears plausible but is entirely fabricated. - **Up-to-date knowledge**: The AI's knowledge is not real-time and may not include the most recent events or developments. - **Bias and harmful content**: In rare cases, the AI might produce biased content or potentially harmful instructions. If you encounter such content, please report it to us at [hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com). - **URL processing**: The AI cannot open, read, or directly access any URLs provided to it. - **Ethical considerations**: The AI doesn't have inherent ethical judgment. You should ensure AI-generated content aligns with your own ethical standards. By being aware of these limitations, you can make the most of our AI Assistant while ensuring your content is high-quality and accurate. Always use your judgment and expertise when reviewing AI-generated suggestions. ## FAQ ### Which AI model does Aitoearn use? Aitoearn's AI Assistant currently utilizes GPT-4.0 technology from OpenAI.
