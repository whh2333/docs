You can choose between 1 time per week, 3 times per week, or 5 times per week.</p> <p>If you select a posting goal at this time, we'll create recommended posting times within your posting schedule based on the goal you choose. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules#Setting-up-your-posting-schedule-with-Posting-Goals-in-Beta-aTUIa">Learn more about how this works here</a>.</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6863e41fd4820f27313e3d30/file-qYv05B7R7Z.jpg" alt="Posting goals screenshot" style="width: 550.98px; " /><br /> <h3 id="Setting-a-posting-goal-for-existing-channels-YjEB1">Setting a posting goal for existing channels</h3> <p>If you skipped the process when connecting your channel, you can always go back and set a goal for your channel.

Posting times are the specific, pre-set time slots when the content in your queue will actually be published. You can set up posting times <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules" target="_blank">by creating a posting schedule for each channel</a>.</p> </article>
