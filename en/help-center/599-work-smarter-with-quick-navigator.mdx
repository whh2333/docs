<article id="fullArticle"> <h1 class="title">Work smarter with Quick Navigator</h1> <a href="javascript:window.print()" class="printArticle" title="Print this article" aria-label="Print this Article"><i class="icon-print"></i></a> <p>Quick Navigator is an amplified search function, allowing you to swiftly access channels, analytics, composer or any frequently visited pages using just your keyboard! Using our Quick Navigator and shortcuts, you can do things like search your channels, open the Ideas composer, or hop from Publish to Analyze, all with a few strokes of the keyboard.</p> <p>In this article:</p> <ol> <li></li><a href="#h_01H966C2P4MQG246GS89ZYK2ZC" target="_self">Accessing Quick Navigator</a></li> <li></li><a href="#h_01H5ADF4W2Q4AA55TR737CHN0K" target="_self">Keyboard Shortcuts</a></li> <li></li><a href="#h_01H5ADFH8XTTJQP5QSXTJJVRA9" target="_self">Full Command List</a></li> </ol> <h2 id="h_01H966C2P4MQG246GS89ZYK2ZC">Accessing Quick Navigator</h2> <ol> <li>Use [CMD]/[CTRL] + [k] to open the Quick Navigator.</li> <li>Type your search in the field. We will show matching results as soon as you start typing.</li> <li>Navigate the results with your up and down cursor keys.</li> <li>Run the command by pressing [ENTER]/[RETURN] on your keyboard.</li> </ol> <h3 id="h_01H966C2P4JHAQXZYGAJ1JKHBF">Jump between pages with nested commands</h3> <p>While commands might be enough for some, they weren't for us. That's why we created commands within commands (a.k.a. nested commands). Feel free to watch this 20-second video or read the steps below.</p> <div class="video video-youtube video-responsive" style="aspect-ratio:16 / 9;"> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GpJVnPIrDH4" width="100%" height="100%" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </div> <p>For example, you may want to directly jump to the Drafts tab in a specific channel. To do this from the Quick Navigator, follow these steps:</p> <ol> <li>Open the Quick Navigator using [CMD/CTRL] + [k] and type your channel name,</li> <li>Use your up and down arrows to highlight your desired channel,</li> <li>Press [TAB] to see the options available to you and select one by clicking or using your up/down arrows + [RETURN/ENTER].</li> </ol> <div class="callout-blue"> <h4 id="h_01H965HXSAPRJWTT4S1YXCXQ8R">üìù Good-to-Knows</h4> <ul> <li>To easily navigate to any of your social channel queues, type "channels" to see a list.</li> <li>To quickly see all channels for a certain network, type the network name, e.g. "Facebook".</li> </ul> </div> <h2 id="h_01H5ADF4W2Q4AA55TR737CHN0K">Keyboard shortcuts</h2> <p>While using the Quick Navigator, you'll see keyboard shortcuts displayed for certain commands.&nbsp;</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6742048915f570c6a9338/file-zFRjm8UnrT.jpg" alt="Quick navigator search for" style="max-width: 100%; " /> <p>Take note of these keyboard shortcuts so you can run commands <em>without even opening</em> the Quick Navigator. For example, from anywhere in Buffer, use "ga" to have Buffer speedily pop you into your Analyze tab (ga = <strong>g</strong>o to <strong>a</strong>nalytics).&nbsp;</p> <p>You'll find a list of shortcuts below in the full command list.</p> <h2 id="h_01H5ADFH8XTTJQP5QSXTJJVRA9">Full Command List</h2> <p>Before using a command under the "What to type" column, ensure your Quick Navigator is open by using [CMD]/[CTRL] + [k]. You can use any of the "Shortcut" commands without the Quick Navigator.</p> <table class="hs-table"> <colgroup> <col> <col width="220"> <col width="161"> <col> </colgroup> <tbody> <tr> <th>Action desired</th> <th style="width: 220px;">What to type</th> <th style="width: 161px;">Shortcut</th> <th>Action taken</th> </tr> <tr> <td>Go to a channel's queue</td> <td>Channel name</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Takes you to that channel's queue</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Create a new Post</td> <td>"New post"</td> <td>np</td> <td>Opens the composer within your Publish tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Create a new Idea</td> <td>"New idea"</td> <td>ni</td> <td>Takes you to the ideas composer within your Create tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Connect a channel or manage your channels</td> <td><p>"New channel"</p><p>"Manage channel"</p></td> <td>nc</td> <td>Takes you to the Channel connection area within your Settings area</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Open your Analyze tab</td> <td>"Analyze"</td> <td>ga</td> <td>Takes you to the Analyze tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Open your Engage tab</td> <td>"Engage"</td> <td>ge</td> <td>Takes you to the Engage tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Open your Publish tab</td> <td>"Publish"</td> <td>gp</td> <td>Takes you to the Publish tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Open your Start Page editor</td> <td>"Start Page"</td> <td>gs</td> <td>Takes you to the Start Page editor</td> </tr> <tr> <td>View all of your ideas</td> <td>"Ideas"</td> <td>gi</td> <td>Takes you to the Create tab to see all of your ideas</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visit the Calendar view</td> <td>"Schedule"</td> <td>gc</td> <td>Opens your Calendar view</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Submit a feature request</td> <td>"Feedback Feature"</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Opens <a href="https://buffer.com/feature-request" rel="noopener noreferrer">Buffer | Feature Request Form</a> in a new tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Visit the Help Center</td> <td><p>"Support"</p><p>"help"</p></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Opens Buffer's Help Center in new tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>View our latest feature improvements</td> <td>"Whats new"</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Opens <a href="https://buffer.com/whats-new" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://buffer.com/whats-new</a> in a new tab</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Get in touch</td> <td><p>"Support"</p><p>"help"</p></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Opens the help widget in the lower right-hand corner</td> </tr> <tr> <td>View all of the channels of a certain social network (i.e., all of your Instagram channels)</td> <td>Type the social network name</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Shows all channels of that network type</td> </tr> <tr> <td>View all of your channels</td> <td>"channel"</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Lists all of the channels you have connected to Buffer</td> </tr> <tr> <td>See your billing information, such as invoices, plan, and next payment amount</td> <td><p>"Billing"</p><p>"Invoice"</p><p>"Receipt"</p><p>"Plan"</p></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Lands you in the Billing page within your Settings area</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Change your email or password, or delete your Buffer account</td> <td><p>"Account"</p><p>"Email" "Password"</p></td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>Sends you to your Profile Settings page</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Schedule a post from the Publish composer</td> <td></td> <td>While in the Publish tab, open the composer and use CTRL/CMD+Enter</td> <td>Schedules your post for the next available time slot in your posting schedule</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Add new threaded posts</td> <td></td> <td>While in the Publish tab, open the composer and use Shift+Enter</td> <td>Adds a new thread to your post for Threads or X/Twitter</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Schedule a post and create another (i<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/642-scheduling-posts#New-scheduling-options-in-Beta-tin_w">n Beta</a>)</td> <td></td> <td>While in the Publish tab, open the composer and use CTRL/CMD+Shift+Enter</td> <td>Schedules your post for you and keeps the composer open so you can create another post.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Dismiss a comment in the Engage tab</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>While in the Engage tab, use CTRL/CMD+D</td> <td>Dismisses the comment you're on</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Go back to the previous comment within the Engage tab</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>While in the Engage tab, use the up key</td> <td>Takes you to the previous comment</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Go to the next comment within the Engage tab</td> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td>While in the Engage tab, use the down key</td> <td>Takes you to the next comment</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </article>
