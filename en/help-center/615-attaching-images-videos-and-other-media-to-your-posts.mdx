# Attaching images, videos, and other media to your posts When scheduling posts, the option to include images and videos (and how many of each) will vary depending on the social network. In this article: - [Table of how many images and videos can be shared on each social network](#How-many-images-and-videos-can-be-shared-on-each-network-X8Rg9) - [Link previews](#h_01ERDKWRXNCVP987H5Z7D6DH8B) - [Suggested media](#h_01ERDKWYPJWCCDZSW3EEK7KPWA) - [Image, Video and GIF upload](#h_01ERDKX631C5880FTFW7785CEJ) - [Images](#Images-QvQyq) - [Using hosted images](#Using-hosted-images-fTU47) - [Reordering images](#Re-ordering-images-CFUr9) - [Video](#Video-mypD6) - [GIF](#GIF-hGgS0) ## How many images and videos can be shared on each network | | **Link preview** | **Suggested media** | **Image upload** | **Video upload** | **GIF upload** | | | **Facebook** | ‚úì | ‚úì (*10) | ‚úì (*10) | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | | | **Instagram** | | ‚úì (*10) | ‚úì (*10) | ‚úì (1) | | | **X/Twitter** | ‚úì | ‚úì (4) | ‚úì (4) | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | | | **LinkedIn** | ‚úì | ‚úì (9) | ‚úì (9) | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | | | **Pinterest** | | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | | | **TikTok** | | | ‚úì (*10) | ‚úì (1) | | | **Google Business** | | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | | | | **Mastodon** | ‚úì | ‚úì (4) | ‚úì(4) | ‚úì(1) | ‚úì(1) | | | **YouTube** | | | | ‚úì (1) | | | **Threads** | ‚úì (20) | ‚úì (20) | ‚úì (1) | | | **Bluesky** | ‚úì (4) | ‚úì (4) | ‚úì (1) | ‚úì (1) | | ** When scheduling to both Facebook or Instagram and another social channel via **Buffer's Omnibox**, you ****can ****upload up to 10 images but when you click the ****Customize for each network ****button, only the number of images permitted for that social channel will populate. For instance, if you're scheduling to both Facebook and LinkedIn and you upload 10 images, when you click ****Customize for each network****, you'll see that only 9 of your images show within your LinkedIn composer while all 10 show up within your Facebook composer. This is because it's only possible to publish 9 images at a time through LinkedIn. * - It's only possible to upload one type of media at a time. For example, if you upload a video, you won't be able to upload images to that same post. - Did you know you can also copy/paste images into the web composer? Try it out! ## Link previews When you add a link into Buffer we look at the information provided on the website and generate a preview based on what we anticipate the social networks will display using the Open Graph tags (these are created by the owner of the website you're linking to). Link previews mirror what you would see if you were sharing a link natively to those social networks. If you prefer not to have the link displaying in the body of the post, you can remove it from the composer after the link preview has been generated. ![Buffer composer with LinkedIn and Facebook selected and an arrow pointing to the title within the link preview](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998df8eafb48f4e81359/img-1662243-1695848843-784652267.png) For **Facebook**, though we pull from Open Graph data, the preview is ultimately determined by Facebook itself, meaning that they do not rely on the exact same preview that we display. For **X/Twitter**, they don't allow third party apps like Buffer to provide the link preview information; instead, they generate it based on the information they see on the URL. For **LinkedIn**, link previews can be customized, meaning you're able to modify the title, description, and image if you wish. For **Mastodon**, link previews can appear differently based on the way a server/instance is set up (as part of that server's theme settings), and based on your followers viewing preference settings and device. Some mobile clients have previews disabled by default, for example. For **Bluesky**, link previews are fully customizable‚Äîyou're able to adjust the thumbnail, description, and title to fit your post exactly as you‚Äôd like. üìù Facebook only allows customization of link previews if you are sharing a link to your own blog or website and you have set up Domain Verification through Facebook. This means that if you are sharing a link to somebody else's blog or website, you will not be able to customize the link preview. [Learn more about how to set up Facebook Domain Verification here](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/578-setting-up-facebook-domain-verification). ## Suggested media If you would prefer not to use the link preview, you can click ***Replace link preview with image or video***. We will then scrape the link you've included and pull in any images found on the page. You're then able to click on any of those images to include with your post. Revisit the table at the top of this article to see how many suggested media images you're able to add to each of your posts. #### üìù Notes - If you decide to replace the link preview, you'll want to make sure the URL is physically showing in the composer's textbox so that your followers can access it. The image or video you replace the link preview with will not be hyperlinked. - Please keep in mind when using the Suggested Media Feature that you are responsible for ensuring that you have the necessary licenses, rights, consent, and permissions to authorize Buffer to distribute your user content. [For more information please see the User Content section of our Terms of Use](https://buffer.com/legal#terms-of-use). - Suggested media is not supported for TikTok images at this time. ![Buffer composer with an arrow pointing to the suggested media images](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998ef8eafb48f4e8135a/img-1662243-1695848844-1390846689.png) ## Image, video, and GIF uploads You can upload images, videos, or GIFs from your computer, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, as well as certain files from Canva. We have full guides on each of these integrations here: - [A guide to using Canva with Buffer](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/609-a-guide-to-using-canva-with-buffer) - [Attaching media from Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/608-attaching-media-from-dropbox-google-drive-google-photos-and-onedrive) üìù Attached media can also take up character space in your post. If the character count goes down when you add an image, video, or GIF (as it does for X/Twitter and LinkedIn), this is a social network that factors images into your character count allotment. **Images** To see how many images you're able to upload for each social network, revisit the table at the top of this article. We currently support JPG, PNG, HEIC, and WebP image files for all social networks, and additionally GIF files for Facebook, X/Twitter, Mastodon, Bluesky, and Pinterest. Alt-text is available for images posted to LinkedIn. Image size requirements and resizing information for each social network can be found in this guide: [Ideal image sizes and formats for your posts.](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/617-ideal-image-sizes-and-formats-for-your-posts) If you would like to enhance the look of or resize your images using the simple editing functionality right within the Buffer composer, kindly follow this guide: [Editing your images in Buffer](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/614-editing-your-images-in-buffer) ![Buffer composer with an arrow pointing to the Upload image or video option](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998e8820396325b6fdd3/img-1662243-1695848844-268176962.png) **Using hosted images** Learn more about [uploading images from Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, and OneDrive here.](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/608-attaching-media-from-dropbox-google-drive-google-photos-and-onedrive) **Using Unsplash images** Want to add an image but don't have a good one in your own photo library?
