For instance, if you're scheduling to both Facebook and LinkedIn and you upload 10 images, when you click </em><em><strong>Customize for each network</strong></em><em>, you'll see that only 9 of your images show within your LinkedIn composer while all 10 show up within your Facebook composer. This is because it's only possible to publish 9 images at a time through LinkedIn.&nbsp;</em></p> <div class="callout-blue"> <ul> <li>It's only possible to upload one type of media at a time. For example, if you upload a video, you won't be able to upload images to that same post.</li> <li>Did you know you can also copy/paste images into the web composer? Try it out!</li> </ul> </div> <h2 id="h_01ERDKWRXNCVP987H5Z7D6DH8B">Link previews</h2> <p>When you add a link into Buffer we look at the information provided on the website and generate a preview based on what we anticipate the social networks will display using the Open Graph tags (these are created by the owner of the website you're linking to).</p> <p>Link previews mirror what you would see if you were sharing a link natively to those social networks. If you prefer not to have the link displaying in the body of the post, you can remove it from the composer after the link preview has been generated.&nbsp;</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998df8eafb48f4e81359/img-1662243-1695848843-784652267.png" alt="Buffer composer with LinkedIn and Facebook selected and an arrow pointing to the title within the link preview" style="width: 100%; " /> <p>For <b>Facebook</b>, though we pull from Open Graph data, the preview is ultimately determined by Facebook itself, meaning that they do not rely on the exact same preview that we display.</p> <p>For <b>X/Twitter</b>, they don't allow third party apps like Buffer to provide the link preview information; instead, they generate it based on the information they see on the URL.</p> <p>For <b>LinkedIn</b>, link previews can be customized, meaning you're able to modify the title, description, and image if you wish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p> <p>For <b>Mastodon</b>, link previews can appear differently based on the way a server/instance is set up (as part of that server's theme settings), and based on your followers viewing preference settings and device. Some mobile clients have previews disabled by default, for example.</p> <p>For <b>Bluesky</b>, link previews are fully customizable‚Äîyou're able to adjust the thumbnail, description, and title to fit your post exactly as you‚Äôd like.</p> <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìù Facebook only allows customization of link previews if you are sharing a link to your own blog or website and you have set up Domain Verification through Facebook. This means that if you are sharing a link to somebody else's blog or website, you will not be able to customize the link preview. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/578-setting-up-facebook-domain-verification">Learn more about how to set up Facebook Domain Verification here</a>.</p> </div> <h2 id="h_01ERDKWYPJWCCDZSW3EEK7KPWA">Suggested media</h2> <p>If you would prefer not to use the link preview, you can click <em><strong>Replace link preview with image or video</strong></em>. We will then scrape the link you've included and pull in any images found on the page. You're then able to click on any of those images to include with your post.&nbsp;</p> <p>Revisit the table at the top of this article to see how many suggested media images you're able to add to each of your posts.</p> <div class="callout-blue"> <h4 id="01FNWPMRC3R60VT598Y0FX81RN">üìù Notes</h4> <ul> <li>If you decide to replace the link preview, you'll want to make sure the URL is physically showing in the composer's textbox so that your followers can access it. The image or video you replace the link preview with will not be hyperlinked.</li> <li>Please keep in mind when using the Suggested Media Feature that you are responsible for ensuring that you have the necessary licenses, rights, consent, and permissions to authorize Buffer to distribute your user content. </li><a href="https://buffer.com/legal#terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For more information please see the User Content section of our Terms of Use</a>.</li> <li>Suggested media is not supported for TikTok images at this time.</li> </ul> </div> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998ef8eafb48f4e8135a/img-1662243-1695848844-1390846689.png" alt="Buffer composer with an arrow pointing to the suggested media images" style="width: 100%; " /> <h2 id="h_01ERDKX631C5880FTFW7785CEJ">Image, video, and GIF uploads</h2> <p>You can upload images, videos, or GIFs from your computer, Dropbox, Google Drive, or OneDrive, as well as certain files from Canva.
