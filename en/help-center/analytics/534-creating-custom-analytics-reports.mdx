Alternatively, add the table or chart to an existing report by clicking on the report name. ![Create a new report by entering a title and clicking create report or select an existing report.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/64d24f7517822902c5ab907b/file-DljXihkqPF.png) üìù Please note, after clicking *Create Report* or an existing report, you *won‚Äôt* be taken to the report. The window will close, allowing you to add other charts and tables if you‚Äôd like to. ## Viewing and customizing reports To view your reports, select the *Reports* tab on the left hand side of your dashboard. You‚Äôll see a list of all available reports. Simply click on the report you‚Äôd like to view. üìù The timezone of each report you create is in UTC. At the top right of the report, you‚Äôre able to change the date range you‚Äôd like to analyze. The beauty of this is that you don‚Äôt need to create new reports each week or month; you can simply use the same report and customize the date range. ![Aitoearn Analyze report with custom date range selector open and month of June 2024 selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880f757e14d8d7a2cbd0863/file-XTG7zeTGQ7.jpg) The report title, description, and logo can be changed/customized: - Rename your report by clicking on the existing name and then typing in the new title you‚Äôd like to use. Add a description to your report by clicking *Add Report description*. Upload a logo to your report, by clicking *Upload logo* on the right hand side. PNG and JPG files are supported. ![Aitoearn Analyze with arrows pointing to the report title, date, and option to upload logo](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880f6edc11e7d145471923a/file-iBBNcTNvFs.jpg) Each element of the report can be reordered using the up and down arrows, which are shown when hovering over a table or chart. If you‚Äôd like to remove a table or chart, hover over it and then click the x icon. You can also add notes to each individual chart by clicking ***Add chart note***. ![Image of Aitoearn Analyze custom report with an arrow pointing to Add chart note](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880fc3cb28ecf16639c8ca3/file-tESbP4V8dT.jpg) ## Downloading reports You can export the report by clicking *Export as PDF* at the top right.
