# Posts tab in Buffer Analyze The Posts tab within your analytics dashboard provides a history of your published posts. Looking at your posts individually allows you to draw comparisons and see patterns around which posting times might be working best for you, how your boosted posts are performing, and what type of content your audience might be most engaged with. ‚≠êÔ∏è This feature is on our [paid plans](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-buffer-plan).

Click *Posts*. - Choose the date range you'd like to view. ![Buffer Analyze Posts report](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/661fe2a2734e0c0c779a5cd9/file-j6IIsgDGbM.jpg) ## Diving into your report ### Summary table The summary table shows aggregate metrics for all posts published during the selected date range. We'll show you impressions, reach, users, comments, and your engagement rate. Buffer's analytics dashboard also shows you insights for boosted Facebook posts or promoted Instagram posts. Learn tips on which posts to boost and how to best measure your results in our blog post [here](https://buffer.com/resources/boosted-post-insights/)! Organic posts and boosted posts are represented by blue and green respectively in the bar chart. The percentages indicate any change in metrics compared to the previous period. So, for example, if you have the last 7 days set as your date range, the percentage change will be a comparison to the previous 7-day period before that. ![Post summary showing Posts, Reach, Reactions, Comments, Shares and Engagement Rate counts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499586241295a81ba6db2/img-1656503-1695848790-854412992.png) üìù If you‚Äôre not seeing boosted posts data, it could be because you need to allow permission for this. Learn more in the article: [Why isn't my ad data displayed on boosted posts?](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/516-why-isnt-my-ad-data-displayed-on-boosted-posts) ### Hashtag performance table The hashtag performance table provides insight into how your hashtags could be affecting your reach and engagement rates. You can use this information to inform your posting strategy by looking at posts with hashtags that are associated with the highest reach and engagement rates. At the moment, only the top five hashtags that had the most engagement in the date range selected are shown in this table. üìù Hashtags included in both the main caption of the post and the first comment are shown in this table. The average reach and average engagement rate for your hashtags are based on your organic posts only. They do not include the additional reach and engagement from boosting. Additionally, for LinkedIn and X/Twitter, we show your average impressions because their APIs do not provide the reach metric. ![Buffer analytics dashboard hashtag performance chart](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499586241295a81ba6db3/img-1656503-1695848790-1187295208.png) ### Posts insights The posts insights table shows you all of your published posts, sorted by impressions in descending order by default. You can filter posts by keywords and hashtags, as well as sort them either by date or another metric. The post time shown is in your browser timezone. For every post that was boosted, you can easily see the proportion of organic and paid results. You can also hover over the bar charts to see the exact breakdown. ![Buffer analytics dashboard showing Post clicks, Reactions, Impressions, Reach, Engagement Rate, and Spend for posts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499588820396325b6fdb8/img-1656503-1695848790-1956577373.png) The post insights table only shows the five key metrics of each post. To see the remaining metrics, click on the image. Within this window, you can hover over the respective bars to see the exact breakdown between organic and paid. ![Buffer analytics dashboard individual post metrics: Impressions, Reach, Reactions, Likes, Comments, Shares, Clicks, Engagement Rate, Total Spend](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499598820396325b6fdb9/img-1656503-1695848791-1031667921.png) üìù If a post has been published and later edited or deleted, the original post will appear in your analytics dashboard and not the edited version. ## Adding metrics to a custom report Finally, you can add any of the tables and charts from this area to a custom report. Simply click the ‚ûï plus button at the top right of any chart you'd like to include.
