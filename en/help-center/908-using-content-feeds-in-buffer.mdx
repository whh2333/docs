To help keep your feeds organized, you can group your feeds together by topic or theme in a **content collection. ** For example, you could include several RSS feeds related to running in a collection called "Running Tips" so you can scroll that collection for inspiration when you'd like to create a post or idea related to running. ### Creating new content collections - Head to the "Create" tab of the web dashboard. - Click Feeds. - Next, click Add collection. ![Add Collection option in Feeds](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1f18efa0d2b6a41fd4828/file-TLpqEKT7Xg.jpg) - Enter the name for your collection and press Enter/Return to save it. You can now start adding some feeds! ### Renaming content collections By default, your first collection will be named "My collection," so you can rename it using the following steps: - Find the content collection you'd like to rename. - Click the three dots ... next to its name. - Select Rename from the dropdown menu, enter the new name, and you're set. ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1f018c6b0132d4a17b9d1/file-AF33gLZNAD.jpg) ## Deleting content collections - Under **Feeds, **select the collection you wish to delete.

A feed is a stream of content automatically pulled from an external source, such as a blog or news website, that you can use for content ideas. ### What is the benefit of creating collections? Collections help you organize similar feeds, making it easier to find specific content topics or themes. ### What happens if I hit my feed limit (3 feeds on the Free plan, 50 feeds on paid plans)? You‚Äôll need to remove an existing feed or, if you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade your plan to add more. ### What if I try to import an OPML file that exceeds my limits? The import will not complete, and you'll be notified to either reduce your feeds or upgrade your account if you're on the Free plan. ### Is there a limit to how many articles Buffer displays per feed? Buffer shows all available items provided by the feed itself, typically 10-20 recent articles, but this depends entirely on the individual website. ### If I connect feeds or collections to my team's organization, are they visible only to me or can my team see them too? Feeds and Collections, like Ideas, exist at the org level, meaning users across the full team would be able to view and edit them. ### Do you store articles or track what I've read? We do not currently store articles or track reading status. Feeds refresh live, pulling directly from source websites. ### How often do feeds refresh? Feeds refresh automatically when you access them in Buffer, pulling the latest available articles. ### How are 'Explore Feeds' chosen? 'Explore feeds' selected based on popularity and usefulness, manually curated by our team. There‚Äôs no automated recommendation at this time. ### Why is my feed not loading or why is my feed showing errors? Check the feed URL for accuracy or test it in an external RSS validator tool. Feeds must be RSS or Atom formats. Here are a few resources to check the feed URL: - [https://validator.w3.org/feed/](https://validator.w3.org/feed/) - [https://getrssfeed.com/](https://getrssfeed.com/) - [https://rssfinder.app/](https://rssfinder.app/) ### Why isn‚Äôt a specific article showing in my feed? Buffer displays exactly what the RSS source provides. If an article isn't appearing, it's typically because the site itself hasn't included it in their RSS.
