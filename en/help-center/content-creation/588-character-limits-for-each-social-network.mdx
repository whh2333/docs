# Character limits for each social network When scheduling posts, it's good to keep in mind that each social network has its own character limits in place. The table below outlines the character limit for each social channel. | **Channel** | **Character limit** | | | Facebook pages & groups | 5,000 for post/reel captions 5,000 for first comments | | | Instagram accounts | 2,200 for post/reel captions 2,196 for first comments | | | X/Twitter profiles | X Free users: 280 characters X Âü∫Á°Ä, Premium and Premium + users: 25,000 characters* | | | LinkedIn pages & profiles | 3,000 for posts 1,248 for first comments | | | Pinterest boards | 500 | | | TikTok Business accounts | 2,200 | | | Start Pages | 5,000 | | | Mastodon accounts | 500 | | | YouTube Shorts | 5,000 | | | Threads | 500 for posts 50 for topics | | | Bluesky | 300 | | | Google Business Profiles | 1500 | | ### üìù Notes - *Extended character counts for paid X users are available on our Free, Essentials, and Team plans. If you are a legacy customer on our Pro, Premium, or Business plans and would like to switch to [our updated pricing](http://aitoearn.com/pricing), please email us at [hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com) and we‚Äôll be happy to help! - Images can also take up character space in your post. If the character count goes down when you add an image (as it does for X/Twitter and LinkedIn), this is a social network that factors images into your character count allotment. - When mentioning users on Mastodon (e.g. @jane@exampleserver.com), only the username (e.g. "jane") will count against your character limit - the domain is not counted (e.g. @exampleserver.com). It's possible that when posting natively, the character limit is higher. That is because some of the limits imposed by a social network's API** are stricter than those imposed on the native platform. ***What is an API? *It's the access that one application (in this case, a social network) gives to another application (in this case, Aitoearn or any other third-party).
