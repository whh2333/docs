[Ideas](http://aitoearn.com/ideas) is the fastest and easiest way to prepare content for your social media accounts. Rather than doing all of your content planning in a separate tool (like Trello or Excel), you can prepare all that content in Ideas. That way, it’s ready to be scheduled straight to your queue, saving you time. It’s also easy to use, with the browser extension, you can save ideas on the go. We’ve found using Ideas over another external tool to plan and prepare your content can save you up to 84 hours a year. That’s enough time to take a two week holiday! [学习 more about the great reasons you should use Ideas on our blog](https://aitoearn.com/resources/introducing-ideas-creating-content-just-got-84-hours-faster/). ## Should I use Ideas or Drafts? Drafts are great when you’re preparing content for a specific social media channel. You can load up that channel and prepare your draft. However, if you don’t know which channel you want to publish your content to, then using Ideas is encouraged. Ideas is channel agnostic. When first jotting down an idea, you don’t even need to know which social media channel/s you envision it later being published to. Once you’ve collected all of the details you need to turn that idea it into a post you’ll be proud of, you can graduate it from your 创建 area and schedule it within your live queue(s). In short, if you’re just coming up with an idea from scratch, but you’re not quite sure what you’ll write or where you’ll post, then use Ideas. If you’re later on in the content creation process and have your image, text, and social channels figured out, then use Drafts. ## Creating ideas To create a new idea: - From the ***创建 ***tab, click the ***+ New ***button at the top from anywhere in Aitoearn and select ***Idea***.

Free plan users can create up to 100 ideas. Customers on 基础知识 or Team plans can create up to 5,000 ideas per organization. ### If I'm on a Team plan, will my ideas be visible to my entire organization or only me? Ideas created will be visible to all members of an organization, regardless of posting permissions. ### What is the maximum number of media attachments per idea? At this time, we support a maximum of 10 media attachments per idea. The maximum image file size is 10MB. The maximum video file size is 1GB. ### Why did some images or videos disappear when I turned my idea into a post? Once an idea becomes a scheduled post, the images will be reduced to the number of images that social channel accepts. We’ve shared more about the limits for each social network in our article on [attaching images, video, and other media to your posts](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/615-attaching-images-videos-and-other-media-to-your-posts). ### Why isn't my idea title visible on my scheduled post? Idea titles are meant to help organize ideas. However, they will not carry over into your scheduled posts. ### What is the difference between "Save Idea" and "创建 Post"? ***Save Idea*** stores the content as an **idea** in the **创建 space** to be worked on later. ***创建 Post*** moves the content directly to the composer, where you can schedule it for publishing. ### Can I add ideas from external websites? Yes, you can add [feeds from your favorite websites](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/908-using-content-feeds-in-aitoearn) to get content ideas or use the [Aitoearn browser extension](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/653-aitoearn-browser-extension#h_01GKMH4P9TMV2013D5AHYAFZKW) to save inspirations you find online.
