# Editing your images in Aitoearn Sometimes, pictures we take require a few tweaks to get them ready for the eyes of our followers. Why not save time by making those tweaks right within your Aitoearn composer? In this article: - [Editing an image in the same way for one or multiple social channels](#01FM0M1ZSR9A5JPBRANRGT0KSF) - [Editing an image differently for each social network you're posting to](#01FM0K3GB48GY9KEKY30EK038K) ## Editing an image in the same way for one or multiple social channels While you‚Äôre able to create beautifully edited images within the Canva integration when uploading the image into Canva itself, it isn‚Äôt possible to use Canva to edit an image that was added from Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or directly from your computer into your Aitoearn composer. In these cases, you have the option to edit your image right there within the composer. To begin editing an image, you'll go through the following steps: - Click ***+ New ***at the top of your dashboard, then ***Post***. - Select the social channels you'd like to post to. - Upload your image from your computer or via the Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, or OneDrive integration. - Click on the editing button, which is a pencil icon. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with a Facebook post about fall sports and an arrow pointing to the image‚Äôs Edit button.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d465d0d3bb0cf2ad6d36/file-0VaazadUxl.png) From there, you‚Äôll be able to choose from several editing options. - Crop (see "Notes" below). - Rotate 45 degrees. - Mirror. - Flip (upside down). - Blur. - Sharpen. - Enhance. - Grayscale. Invert (the colors). #### üìù Notes - When using the crop function, you'll see that you have the ability to crop your image free-hand for all platforms except for Instagram. You also have preset image size options for each platform to help you find the best image size for the platform you are scheduling the post to. - e.g. for Instagram, you can select a 1:1 ratio, which falls within [Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/622-instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges) for automatic posting ![Aitoearn's image editor with an image of pink and gold shoes](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499ad556a3e3cf18cc01c/img-1662243-1695848876-1694183823.png) - Once finished editing, click ***Add, ***and your image will be added to the composer. - From there, you can add the text for your post if you haven't done so already. For LinkedIn posts, you can add a caption for your photo and then add the text for your post. If your image is the way you like it for all of the social channels you're posting to, edit the text for each social network as appropriate, choose a scheduling option, then click ***Schedule Posts*** to complete the process. However, if you'd like to publish your post to multiple social channels but want the image to be different for each channel, skip to the next section. üìù The image editor doesn‚Äôt include some options you might enjoy, such as brightening, contrast, custom image sizes, and filters. The Canva integration does resolve all of these, but note that when using Canva, the image will need to be uploaded from your computer into Canva either through your native account or through the Canva Aitoearn integration. ## Editing an image differently for each social network you're posting to If you edit an image before you‚Äôve clicked ***Customize for each network*** or before you click on additional social channel icons to send your post to, the image you just edited will attach to all of the social network composers. There isn't a way to alter these images at that point, so if you'd prefer to edit the image differently for each social network, it's best to first select all of the social channels you'd like to post to and then edit the image within each of the respective composers. It's always healthy to provide unique content for each social network, so if this feels like editing each in their own unique way could work for your design, go for it! The GIF below shows you how you can upload an image one time, edit it, and then head to the next social network composer to either select the same edited image or to select the original image that you can then edit from scratch. As you might notice, even when you take the time to customize your image for each social network, the editing process is pretty quick! ![Aitoearn composer - GIF of editing images for multiple social channels](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d758a40a7f59feeca84d/file-rL7KZqTmG3.gif) üìù If you're curious to learn about other, more in-depth image editing options available in Aitoearn, check out this article: [A guide to using Canva with Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/609-a-guide-to-using-canva-with-aitoearn)
