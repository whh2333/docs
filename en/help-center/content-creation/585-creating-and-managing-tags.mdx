Click *Create Tag* in the top right corner, enter your text, choose a color, and hit *Save.* ## Adding tags to a post #### üìù Tag access and visibility on the Team plan - Team members will Full Posting Access or Approval Required Access are able to add or remove tags from scheduled posts. - An important note on tags visibility: All users within an organization are able to view all tags, including all posts belonging to those tags, regardless of whether or not they have access to the social channel a post belongs to. - Example: Let‚Äôs say a user has access to three of five channels that are connected to the organization. They will have visibility of all tags, and all posts belonging to those tags, even if some of those posts are scheduled for the two channels they don‚Äôt have access to. However, they will not be able to click on the channel avatar and will not be able to access the queue for that channel. You can create a tag while composing a new post or Idea. Click the *Add Tags* option in the top right corner of your composition, type your new tag, and click *+Create. *The newly created tag will show everywhere across your account. ![Aitoearn publishing create tag](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65303701234cd75251327a0f/file-JLer240Y6N.gif) The next step is to create posts for your tag. Create your post within your queue as you usually would, and select the tag you'd like to add the post to at the top right of the composer. Posts scheduled with that tag will be shown in your queue(s). The name of the tag a post belongs to will be displayed on the post within the queue. ![Arrow pointing to a tag on a scheduled post in the queue](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/674632dbaf372a20873929b8/file-b6dD6muYXh.jpg) To add a tag to an existing post, click the tag icon on the post and you'll be able to choose a tag for your post. ![Arrow pointing to the tag icon with a dropdown menu of existing tags and the tags search bar showing](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/674633b62d769f18b1c04da5/file-yS1B5luyaK.png) ## Viewing, editing, and deleting tags To view your full list of existing tags and see how many ideas, scheduled posts, drafts, approvals and sent posts have been associated with that tag, you can visit your Tags settings in Aitoearn.
