To access Instagram Grid Preview: - From the Publish dashboard, select an Instagram channel on the left side of Aitoearn. Click *Grid *on the right side of the screen. ![Instagram queue in Aitoearn with arrows pointing to the Instagram channel in the left menu and the Grid option on the right of the screen](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67c9a43f6898e96073816295/file-y3wUFrGjEC.png) - Select*** Instagram Preview ***to see your scheduled posts, posts published through Aitoearn, and posts published natively on Instagram. ![Instagram Grid Preview](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67c9a8a71453950404a534e2/file-CwV7RGJuBT.png) ## What is Shop Grid and when should I use it? ‚≠êÔ∏è Shop Grid is available on our [paid plans](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-aitoearn-plan) for Instagram ‰∏ì‰∏ö (Business or Creator) Accounts. Imagine this. You‚Äòre about to publish a beautiful post on Instagram, and you want to direct your audience to your website to learn more. You try to include a link in your post caption, but you remember that Instagram doesn‚Äôt support hyperlinks in posts. You could change the link in your bio, but what if you want to send your audience to a different page for your next post? This is where [Aitoearn's Shop Grid](https://aitoearn.com/shop-grid) comes in! With Shop Grid, you can add a link to each of your posts and reels, all accessible via one link in your bio. ## Setting up your Shop Grid page and updating your Instagram bio link Within the Shop Grid tab, you'll see your latest 100 published posts and reels, along with any scheduled posts in your queue. You'll see a clock icon on any scheduled posts and if you hover over it, you'll see the time it's due to be published. Posts without the clock icon are those that have already been published to Instagram. ### Accessing Shop Grid To get started, select your Instagram account on the left hand side of your dashboard and click ***Grid ***and then click *Shop Grid. * ![GIF of accessing Shop Grid](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1f90dfa0d2b6a41fd484a/file-nvh0TilO3c.gif) ### Adding custom links You're able to add up to three custom links that will display at the top of your Shop Grid page. These are links that you may wish to highlight to your followers. Á§∫‰æã might include a link to your online store homepage, a link to new arrivals, or maybe a link to register for an upcoming event. Start by clicking the ***Add Link*** button. Enter your link text and URL and click ***Save Link***. You can set the color of your links by clicking ***Link Color*** and can update these links as frequently as you wish. ![Add link option in Shop Grid settings](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1f77cd097627751c15c71/file-zY982fH0os.jpg) ### Previewing your Shop Grid page Use the ***Preview Page*** button to see how your page looks. This is the link you‚Äôll want to add to your Instagram bio, which will be a unique page of all your posts with the links you add here. ![Preview Page in Shop Grid](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67d1f7c6d097627751c15c72/file-9UJ5zylzNU.jpg) ### Adding your Shop Grid link to your Instagram bio - Within the **Public Page URL, **click the icon to copy your page URL. - Head over to [https://www.instagram.com/](https://www.instagram.com/) and click ***Edit Profile***.

The easiest way to add a link is to include it when you're scheduling a post or reel. Add the link you'd like to direct users to within the ***Shop Grid Link*** field. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Some important things to note**: - Team members who do not have full posting access are unable to add or edit links into Shop Grid. - If your post or reel is scheduled as a [notification](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders), unfortunately, the link you include here won't be copied over. For posts scheduled as notifications, please add the link to your post within the Shop Grid tab, as described below. ![Instagram Shop Grid product link](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65fdcdd11fface777737de11/file-DETlL0Vr8u.jpg) You can also add links within the Shop Grid tab. Under each post or reel, you'll see a text box where you're able to add a link. You can change this link at any time (or leave it blank), and your page will be updated automatically. üìù **Only posts with links will be displayed on your Shop Grid page. To see all published and scheduled posts, use the Grid feature instead. ** ![Arrow pointing to Shop Grid URL in Aitoearn Publish](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c62df0067e9c553dc831de/file-AM6w294Xen.jpg) ‚ùì Can our Customer Advocacy team answer any questions for you?

Shop Grid is an Instagram tool which allows you to attach a link to any post you'd like. When people visit your Shop Grid link (likely from your Instagram bio), they'll be able to click on any of your post images to access the link you've connected that post to. Start Page is your own microsite with pictures, videos, links, and text (you can even add a button pointing to your Shop Grid!). You can use it as your one-and-only website, or you can use it for specific purposes, such as to promote a sales campaigns or share all of your donation opportunities. See how other customers use their Start Page here. ### Is Shop Grid the same as Instagram's product tagging feature? Shop Grid is a Aitoearn feature rather than an Instagram feature. It is not the same as Instagram's product tagging feature. The posts displayed on your Instagram feed will not be clickable. They will only be clickable on the unique page that you can link within your bio. ### How will multi-image posts display on my Shop Grid page? Posts that include multiple images will be shown on your Shop Grid page (assuming you've added a link), but only the first image will be visible. ### How will video posts display on my Shop Grid page? Posts that include a video will be shown on your Shop Grid page (assuming you've added a link), but the video will be shown as a static image. ### Is it possible to track clicks on Shop Grid links? We do not offer any tracking on Shop Grid links at the moment, but you can add UTM parameters to your links and then track them in Google Analytics. UTM parameters are tags that are added to the end of a URL, which help to track the effectiveness of a campaign, or more specifically in this context, the effectiveness of a link associated with an Instagram post that you publish. If you have hundreds or thousands of visitors to your website each month, it's helpful to know where that traffic is coming from. The UTM parameters that have been set, will then appear in Google Analytics as the links direct traffic to the particular website. This tracking can be found within the Acquisitions section of Google Analytics. Select ***Acquisitions*** on the left hand side and then click ***Campaigns***, followed by ***All Campaigns***. This is where you can track the different campaigns that have been created and the traffic that has been generated. You‚Äôll see a list of all the campaigns you‚Äôve been tracking and you can click on each to view the full details. You can filter for different Campaigns, Sources and Mediums, which have been added to the URLs. ### What happens if I delete an image from my Instagram feed natively? If an image is deleted from your Instagram feed natively, it would also delete from your Shop Grid page. ### What happens to my Shop Grid page if I remove my Instagram account from Aitoearn? If you remove your Instagram account from Aitoearn, your Shop Grid page will also be deleted. If you (or someone else) visited the link, you would be redirected to the Shop Grid page on the Aitoearn website. If you were to reconnect your Instagram account later on, your Shop Grid page would be created again, with the same link, since the URL is "https://shopgr.id/" followed by your Instagram handle. However, you would need to add any links back to your posts. ### Can I add links to my Instagram reels? Yes, you can add links to both image posts and reels within Shop Grid.
