Templates are pre-defined content formats that guide you through creating impactful social media posts. Whether you're promoting a blog post, sharing customer testimonials, or running a limited-time offer, templates provide a clear structure to make your message stand out. Instead of starting from scratch, you can select a template tailored to your goal and customize it with your own text, links, and visuals. ## Why use Templates? Templates help you: - **Save time** by skipping the blank page. - **Stay consistent** with your brand voice and style. - **Increase engagement** with proven post structures. - **Stay inspired** with new content ideas. ## How to use Templates - Go to your Buffer dashboard. - Click "Create" at the top of the dashboard - Select ***Templates*** from the left side bar. Here you can filter templates by topic or choose to view them all. ![Filter templates by topic](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/683709f2e0314d05424443e2/file-MRNPG3Jn1D.jpg) - Choose a template that fits your content goal.
