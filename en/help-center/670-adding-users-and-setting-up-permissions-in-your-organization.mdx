When adding a new user to your organization, you can choose which social channels they see in their Buffer dashboard. For each of those channels, you can choose whether they have <i><b>Full Posting access</b></i> or <i><b>Approval Required</b></i> access.</p> <p><i><b>Full Posting access</b></i> includes the ability to create, schedule, and publish posts for any channel they've been invited to.</p> <p><i><b>Approval Required access</b></i> includes the ability to create a draft for admin/owner approval. (Note they will not be able to create posts from the Calendar view). Here's a video that explains the process of <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts#01EKCQWCD3GENS0BW0QGHD6KJQ">Requesting Approval and Approving Draft Posts</a>.</p> <p>Lastly, you can decide if any of your users should have <i><b>Admin</b></i> capability. Choose wisely, as users with Admin access have full control over all the channels you've connected.</p> <p>Users with admin access won't automatically have access to all channels and will need to be added or add themselves to channels. Admins can also connect new channels.</p><br /> <table class="hs-table"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Tool</strong></td> <td><strong>Admin access</strong></td> <td><strong>Full posting access (channel specific)</strong></td> <td><strong>Approval required access (channel specific)</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Account settings</td> <td> <ul> <li>Connect and manage social channels</li> <li>Invite and manage users</li> <li>Manage subscription and billing</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>Read-only access to channels area</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>Read-only access to channels area</li> </ul></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Publishing</td> <td> <ul> <li>Dependent on permissions level granted for that social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access)</li> <li>Create, edit, and delete tags from tags list</li> <li>Create ideas and view all ideas within the organization</li> <li>Create groups for ideas</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>Create posts</li> <li>Edit and delete scheduled posts</li> <li>Approve draft posts from other team members</li> <li>Adjust posting schedules</li> <li>Add or remove tags from scheduled posts</li> <li>Create ideas and view all ideas within the organization</li> <li>Create posts with Shop Grid links</li> <li>Edit posts with Shop Grid links</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>Create draft posts</li> <li>Create ideas and view all ideas within the organization</li> <li>Add or remove tags from scheduled posts</li> <li>Create posts with Shop Grid links (need to be approved by team member with Full Posting Access)</li> <li>Not able to edit Shop Grid links</li> </ul></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Engagement</td> <td> <ul> <li>Dependent on permissions level granted for that social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access)</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>Respond to all Instagram and Facebook comments</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>None - Team members must have Full Posting access to use the engagement tool</li> </ul></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Analytics</td> <td> <ul> <li>Viewing metrics</li> <li>Create custom reports</li> <li>View tags</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>View metrics</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>View metrics</li> </ul></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Start Page</td> <td> <ul> <li>Start Page creation</li> <li>Editing</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>No access</li> </ul></td> <td> <ul> <li>No access</li> </ul></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h2 id="h_a374af7f-8c95-4edb-ab97-0e12dc4b217d">Inviting users</h2> <p>Our Team plan supports unlimited team members, so you can invite your team to help you create and manage your content.
