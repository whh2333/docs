# Features available on each Buffer plan <a href="javascript:window.print()" class="printArticle" title="Print this article" aria-label="Print this Article"><i class="icon-print"></i></a> Buffer offers both paid subscriptions and a Free plan. - The*** Free plan*** is ideal for individual users looking to schedule content on up to 3 social channels.</li> - The ***Essentials plan*** offers more features than the Free plan and includes access to Buffer’s advanced analytics, reporting, and engagement tools.</li> - The ***Team plan*** includes the same features as the Essentials plan but includes unlimited users and collaboration features so you can work alongside your team.</li> ### How much does it cost to upgrade? <p>All of our paid plans are on a per-channel pricing model, so you pay for each channel you have connected to Buffer. To calculate the cost of your plan, you can check out [our pricing calculator.](http://buffer.com/pricing)</p> ### What counts as a channel? Each social account you connect is a channel. For instance, a Facebook Page, Facebook Group, X/Twitter profile, Linked Page, and Linked Profile would count as 5 channels. ### Do you offer a free trial of your plans? <p>Yes, we [offer a free 14-day trial](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/549-information-about-free-trials) so you can explore our paid features. If you start a free trial, you'll be placed on a trial of our Team plan, which includes access to our publishing, engagement, and analytics features. It also allows you to explore our paid features, including team functions such as inviting other users, setting up posting permissions, and draft/post approvals.</p> ### Plan and feature table:

This lifetime limit does not apply to [our paid plans.](http://buffer.com/pricing)</p> </div>
