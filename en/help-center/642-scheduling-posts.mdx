However, if you'd like to schedule a post to multiple social accounts at once and click the <em><strong>Customize for each network button</strong></em>, only the number of images permitted for that social channel will populate. For example, if you're scheduling both Instagram and LinkedIn posts and upload 10 images when you click Customize for each network, you will see that only nine of your images shows within your LinkedIn composer while all 10 display for your Instagram composer. This is because it is only possible to publish nine images at a time through LinkedIn.</li> <li></li><b>LinkedIn </b><strong>Document Scheduling: </strong>We are able to schedule PDFs on LinkedIn (one per post with a maximum file size of 100MB and 300 pages).</li> <li></li><strong>Link shortening:</strong> On the Free plan, all links will be shortened using the buff.ly link shortener. On our paid plans, you're able to decide which link shortener to use by heading to <em><strong>Settings</strong></em>. Pinterest does not allow link shortening, so be sure to use a full URL in the destination URL box.</li> <li></li><strong>Facebook page and X/Twitter mentions:</strong> To mention a Facebook page or X/Twitter profile, simply type the @ symbol and start typing the first few letters of the page or profile you'd like to mention.

Please note that once a post has been deleted, it cannot be recovered.</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6841eb2f3e492d087e003353/file-QzJm200Hcb.jpg" alt="Option to delete a scheduled post within the Buffer Publish dashboard" style="width: 616.98px; " /> <h3>Can I view all of my scheduled posts in one place?</h3> <p>Yes, you can view all of your scheduled posts in one list using the All Channels view. This view allows you to filter your scheduled posts by channel and tag. Learn more about <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/861-how-to-use-the-all-channels-view-in-buffer">How to use the All Channels view in Buffer here</a>.</p> <h3>How can I delete or edit a published post?</h3> <p>At this time, we are unable to edit or delete a post once it's been published through Buffer. Instead, you'll need to edit or delete the published post directly on the social network. You can find a history of your published posts <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-posts-within-your-publishing-dashboard">within the Sent tab of the Publish dashboard</a>.</p> <h3>Can I share evergreen content with Buffer?</h3> <p>At this time, it is not possible to create a post once and have it repeat indefinitely. However, you can use <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/660-share-posts-with-the-share-again-feature" target="_blank">our Duplicate feature to repeat a post</a>.</p> <h3>Do you support bulk scheduling? Can I upload my posts in bulk? Can I import my posts in bulk?</h3> <p>Yes, you can upload your posts in bulk with Buffer. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/926-how-to-upload-posts-in-bulk-to-buffer">Learn more about how bulk uploads work in Buffer here</a>.</p> <h3>How do I schedule a post for multiple channels?</h3> <p>In the composer, choose the channels you want to post to by selecting them individually (selected channels will appear in color).</p> <p>If you frequently post to the same set of channels, you can also create a <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/927-using-channel-groups-in-buffer">channel group</a> to easily select multiple channels at once.</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6877cd91522f451361e7f597/file-oUpI3vykpS.gif" alt="GIF of selecting multiple channels in the Buffer composer" style="width: 561px; " /> <h3>Can I group channels together when scheduling posts?</h3> <p>Yes! You can use <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/927-using-channel-groups-in-buffer">channel groups</a> to organize multiple social media channels and schedule posts to them at once. This is especially helpful if you frequently post the same content across several platforms or manage multiple brand accounts.</p> <h3>I've created a post for multiple channels and need to edit my post. Can I edit scheduled posts in bulk?</h3> <p>At this time, we don't have a way to edit posts in bulk. If you're creating the same post for multiple channels, once it's been scheduled, we consider each post to be its own separate post. Therefore, you'll have to edit each post separately. If you'd like to see us support bulk editing in the future, <a href="https://suggestions.buffer.com/p/bulk-editing-of-posts">you can upvote this idea on our suggestions board</a>.</p> <h3>Can I use Buffer to auto-repost or auto-share to channels not connected to Buffer?</h3> <p>No. We are not able to automatically repost content for you. The <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/653-buffer-browser-extension">Buffer extension</a> allows you to select individual X/Twitter posts to repost (retweet), but it is not automatic.</p> <p>Buffer can only publish to channels that are connected to Buffer and have been selected in the composer when you create your post. Once your content is posted through Buffer, it will not be automatically posted to other social networks, even if you have settings enabled to allow this to happen when posting natively.</p> <ul> <li>For example, Instagram posts sent through Buffer will not automatically publish to Facebook, even if the setting is turned on within the Instagram app. This is due to API limitations. To publish a post to both Instagram and Facebook, both channels will need to be connected to Buffer and you will need to select both channels in the composer when you create your post.</li> </ul> <h3>Are there tools to help me consistently schedule and publish posts using Buffer?</h3> <p>Yes! Our<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/907-understanding-streaks-in-buffer" target="_blank"> streaks feature</a> tracks how many weeks you've consistently published content through Buffer. Keep your streak going by publishing content each week and watch the number grow.</p> <p>You can also <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/912-setting-posting-goals-in-buffer">create posting goals</a> for the number of times you'd like to post per channel per week. You can easily track your goal progress right from the channel's queue.</p> <h3>Can I use custom fonts or formatted text in my scheduled posts?</h3> <p>Buffer does not have a formatting text option within our composer. To add rich text or formatted text to your scheduled posts, you can use an online text formatting tool such as <a href="https://yaytext.com" target="_blank">YayText</a> to format your text and then paste it into the Buffer composer and schedule your post.</p> </article>
