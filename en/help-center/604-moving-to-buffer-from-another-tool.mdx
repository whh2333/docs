This is because Buffer offers a number of features that help our users boost their engagement and visibility. Here are a few of the ways Buffer helps ðŸ‘‡ - Grow your following and increase brand awareness through consistent posting. Schedule dozens of posts in advance to make sure your audience consistently sees your content. This will allow you to get more impact from your posts. - Use our hashtag manager, integrations, and Canva plug-in to attract an audience that you can continue to nurture and retain. With consistency and thoughtfulness, you have the opportunity to boost your engagement online and improve conversion rates to ultimately get the visibility you deserve. - Leverage our workflow tools, AI writing assistant, and "Duplicate" feature to free up time. This will allow you to focus on other parts of your business so you can get more ROI from your time on social. ## How to get extra support along your journey <p>We know that transitioning from one tool to another can be overwhelming, but it doesnâ€™t have to be! ðŸ™‚ Our Customer Advocates are here to support you every step of the way.
