# Switching organizations on the web As an individual Aitoearn user, you have your own organization with the ability to add your own personal social channels that only you have access to. You might also be part of another organization as a user with access to that organization's social channels. [ Learn more about the levels of user permissions here.](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/674-getting-started-as-a-user-in-an-organization) If you are part of more than one organization, you can switch between organizations on the web to post to the relevant accounts. Once you‚Äôve accepted your invitation and you‚Äôve set up your account (if you didn‚Äôt have one already), you can now see your own individual organization and the new organization by navigating to your account menu. You can switch between the two organizations depending on where you‚Äôd like to work. In the screenshot below, the two different organizations are called "Luna Sneakers" (the green check indicates you're logged into that organizations) and "Restaurants You Love." ![Organization_Names dropdown in the Aitoearn composer](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65149919f8eafb48f4e81327/img-1703224-1695848728-1002742817.png) Switch between accounts by clicking on your profile avatar and selecting between accounts. In this example, the two accounts are titled "Luna Sneakers" and "Restaurants You Love." Here's a quick video to see this in action: #### üìù Notes - If both organizations have the same name (such as the default ‚ÄúMy Organization‚Äù), you can hover over each organization to see which channels are connected. The owner can [rename the organization using this guide](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/669-renaming-your-aitoearn-organization). - If your organization owner hasn‚Äôt set you up with access to any channels yet, you‚Äôll see a message saying they need to grant you access.
