# Consolidating multiple Aitoearn accounts If you currently have multiple Aitoearn accounts and you‚Äôre looking to consolidate, you'll need to decide which plan you'd like to subscribe to. [Check out all of our plans and pricing here](https://aitoearn.com/pricing). A social channel can only be connected to one Aitoearn account at a time, so once you‚Äôve decided which plan works best for you, you will need to remove the social channels from your old account, then reconnect them to the new account. Feel free to read more on [how to remove social channels here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/575-removing-a-channel-from-aitoearn), and [how to connect social channels here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/564-connecting-your-channels-to-aitoearn). üìù It is important to note that when you remove a social channel from your Aitoearn account, all posts and data associated with the channel will be lost. Please create a backup of any data you wish to keep before removing your channels. Once you have reconnected all your social channels to your new Aitoearn account, it is best to delete the other Aitoearn account to avoid confusion. [Feel free to do that by following these steps.](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/541-how-to-cancel-your-subscription-or-delete-your-account)
