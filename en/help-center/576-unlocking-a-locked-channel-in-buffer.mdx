<p>If you no longer need certain channels, you can&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/575-removing-a-channel-from-buffer" target="_self">remove the channels from Buffer</a>, which will then unlock the channels you're looking to keep.</p>
<div class="callout-red">
 <p><i><b>Note: </b></i>removing channels will also permanently remove any queued posts, analytics, and post history. This cannot be undone.</p>

<p>If you'd rather not delete any channels (for example, if you would like to keep them connected in case you upgrade again in the future or would like to keep the post history), you can choose which channels to unlock using the steps below:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click&nbsp;<em><strong>Channels </strong></em>from the drop down menu.</li>
 <li>Find the channel you wish to unlock and then click&nbsp;<strong><em>Unlock </em></strong>next to the channel:</li>
</ol>

<ol start="4">
 <li>You will now see a window showing all of your channels. Tick the checkboxes to the left of the channels you’d like to keep active. Channels not ticked will remain (or become) locked. If you attempt to keep more channels active than your plan limits allow, you’ll see an error message.</li>
</ol>

<p>An alternate route to unlock your channels is by following these steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click&nbsp;<em><strong>Billing</strong></em> from the drop down menu.</li>
 <li>Click <em><strong>Unlock.</strong></em></li>
</ol>

<h3>What will happen to my scheduled posts if my channel is locked?</h3>
<p>If a channel is locked with posts still scheduled in its queue, the posts will remain in the queue, but won't publish until the channel is unlocked. Once unlocked, you might need to reschedule some of your posts if the posting time has passed.</p>
