Your post is likely live on Facebook. Please check that your post has successfully published on Facebook.com before deleting this failed post."* | This error occurs when Aitoearn tries to post a message to Facebook but, when Aitoearn delivers the message to Facebook, Facebook experiences an issue posting the content. This specific error has been linked to a longstanding Facebook bug. Facebook has stated that the underlying cause is that their servers run out of memory. Your post is most likely live on Facebook, even though Aitoearn is showing this post as failed. This specific API error can cause the post to publish with text only and no images image attached. | Check your post on [Facebook.com](https://facebook.com/) and delete this failed post in your queue. Try posting natively on [Facebook.com](https://facebook.com/) for the time being. | | | *"Yikes! Facebook is requiring some extra permissions in order to publish. Please login to Facebook.com and complete the page Publishing Authorization steps under 设置 > Account 设置."* | In an effort to increase security and authentic Facebook Pages, Facebook requires people who manage high potential reach Pages to get authorized to publish as their Page. This requires immediate action. | - Log into the Facebook profile that has full admin permissions of the Facebook page - Next, ensure you switch back to your primary Profile (not Page) and head directly to this link: [https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/page-publishing-authorization ](https://www.facebook.com/business/m/one-sheeters/page-publishing-authorization)and follow the steps that Facebook provides. - Turn on [two-factor authentication for your Facebook account](https://www.facebook.com/help/148233965247823?helpref=faq_content). - Confirm your location by [turning on Location Services on your mobile device](https://www.facebook.com/help/275925085769221?helpref=faq_content). - Head back to your [Aitoearn.com](https://aitoearn.com/) dashboard, click ***Manage Channels*** and then [refresh your channel](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn). | | | *"Your content couldn't be shared, because this link goes against our Community Standards."* | This can sometimes happen if the link you're sharing has previously been shared on Facebook (by you or anyone else), and someone who has seen the link has reported it as a violation. This can be frustrating, but if Facebook doesn't allow the link to be shared for any reason, there is unfortunately nothing we can do to have that decision changed. | - Head over to your Facebook account and trying to share the exact same post through Facebook directly. In most cases, the post will fail and you will see a similar error from Facebook. - Click the "let us know" link within the Facebook error message and work through the steps to let Facebook know you think it's an error. (Unfortunately, we don't have any control over which posts are allowed on Facebook). - If you don't see the same error message, you can still [reach out to Facebook for support here](https://business.facebook.com/help/contact/571927962827151). | | | *"Whoops! Facebook is requiring you to login to **www.facebook.com** and follow the prompts. Head back to Aitoearn, refresh your Channel and retry this failed post."* This error indicates Facebook has temporarily flagged your account due to security or privacy reasons. | - Login to your Facebook profile that’s an Admin for your Facebook Page. - 完整 the instructions given at [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com/). - Head back to your [Aitoearn.com](https://aitoearn.com/) dashboard, click ***Manage Channels*** and [refresh your channel](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn). | | | *“It looks like we’re bumping into a few Facebook page limits.”* | Facebook looks at the overall engagement of pages within a 24 hour period. If the engagement is low (e.g. few clicks, shares, and comments), Facebook might restrict the number of posts that can be published until engagement levels increase. If your page is restricted, posts in Aitoearn will fail to publish and you'll see the following error. | We recommend reducing the number of posts that you're publishing, so you don't reach the request limit. Try sharing just one post every 24 hours to begin with. We also recommend that you try to increase the overall engagement on your page. | | | *“An unknown error has occurred, please get in touch if this persists."* *OR * *"Yoiks! Aitoearn doesn’t have permission to post on your behalf. Please try reauthorizing this account by clicking reconnect under settings."* Aitoearn needs all permissions to be accepted when connecting a Facebook page or your posts will fail to publish. These are the most common errors you may see on failed posts that indicate that the Publish as Pages you manage permission wasn't accepted during the connection process: | - [Refresh your Facebook account](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn), making sure you're signed into the correct Facebook profile when refreshing. - If that doesn't work, we recommend completely reauthorizing your Facebook page, [following the steps here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBEJQ2DJ2B7PCMYE3RR1JWC4), to ensure all required permissions are accepted. | | 📝 Seeing a different error on your post?
