# Instagram error library When using a scheduling tool like Aitoearn, there will be instances when a social network refuses the post and replies with an error message. Let’s take action on those! Search the “Error” column below for the error you see, and then troubleshoot with the advice in the “Solutions” column on the right. | **Error** | **Reason for error message** | **Solution** | | | *"It looks like Aitoearn has lost the authorization to post to this account. Please reauthorize and try again. If the issue persists, please get in touch! Here are the steps to refresh your connection."* | This error message indicates not all permissions were accepted when this Instagram channel was added. | We recommend viewing our guide on [Reauthorizing the connection between Aitoearn and Facebook or Instagram](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBEJQ2DJ2B7PCMYE3RR1JWC4) to see instructions on how to reauthorize.Please ensure that all profiles/pages and permissions are selected in Facebook > ***Edit settings*** view. Once this is done, retry your post. | | *"Uh oh! The video you attached is in a format Instagram does not support. Please ensure the video is a .MP4 or .mov format and the bitrate is under 5 MBps. Re-upload the video and try again."* | This error pops up when the video size or format is unsupported by Instagram or exceeds Instagram’s video limitations. | Ultimately we recommend following Instagram’s video guidelines [here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/reference/ig-user/media#video-specifications). Edit the video and re-upload to Aitoearn. If the video fits Instagram’s video requirements, try changing the thumbnail of the video to the default thumbnail. | | | *"Uh oh! It doesn’t look like this is correctly set up as a business or creator account. Please ensure your account is configured correctly with automatic publishing by checking out our guide."* | This publishing error can happen when you switch your Instagram business or creator account to a personal account which is not currently supported in Instagram's API. | We recommend [Converting your Instagram account to a business or creator account. ](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBEFDCSJ6GDNVG23SNCVRWP2) | | | *"Whoops! It looks like your account may be temporarily restricted. Please login directly to the Instagram app, add your birthdate to Instagram. Head back to Aitoearn and Refresh your channel."* | This account has been restricted by Instagram. This usually happens when the account violates Instagram's [Community Guidelines](https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119) or [Terms of Use](https://help.instagram.com/581066165581870). | Log in to this account in the Instagram app and follow on-screen instructions to re-enable your account. | | | *"Oops! We ran into issues publishing your post. Please edit the post, alter the text in the caption, re-name the video file, and create a brand new post."* | This error is returned when Instagram’s anti-spam mechanism has been triggered. Instagram intentionally does not share the details to prevent someone trying to circumvent their system. | Our recommendation is to amend the post - alter the copy/text, change the picture (if attached), etc., and try to publish again. Tips: - If you’re frequently using specific hashtags, try altering the hashtags and trying new ones. - Is there a link included in the text caption? If so, we recommend removing the link and using the link in bio instead. - Most importantly, if the post contains a video, try renaming the video file & re-uploading to Aitoearn. Removing any special characters in the video name and renaming it something simpler, like “Video1.” | | | *"It looks like Aitoearn has lost authorization to post on your behalf. No need to worry, though! Here are the steps to re-authorize Aitoearn."* | This error message indicates we no longer have a valid access token for this channel. | We recommend viewing our guide on [Reauthorizing the connection between Aitoearn and Facebook or Instagram](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBEJQ2DJ2B7PCMYE3RR1JWC4) to see instructions on how to reauthorize.Please ensure that all profiles/pages and permissions are selected in Facebook > ***Edit settings*** view. Once this is done, retry your post. | | *"Oops! Instagram is restricting this post from being published. Please edit the post content and try again."* | This error message indicates Instagram considers the content to be spam. Their servers are saying: "The publishing action is suspected to be spam. We restrict certain activity to protect our community. Let us know if you can determine that the publishing actions is not spam." | We recommend to [reach out to Instagram directly](https://help.instagram.com/contact/505535973176353) to resolve the issue. | | | *"Oops, we couldn't share this image to Instagram because you tagged an account that is either private or does not exist. Would you be up for checking the tagged usernames to make sure they are all publicly accessible?"* | This error message indicates you've tried to tag a username and it’s invalid. | We recommend checking your post and its tagged user(s), as there might be a typo or another mistake. | | | *"So sorry this post hit an Instagram API bug that is being investigated. Retrying this post might sometimes do the trick."* | The media is not ready for publishing. | Please wait for a moment and try again. | | | *"The daily posting limit for this channel has been reached! Please try reducing the amount of times per day in your schedule and try again later."* | Instagram allows accounts to publish a maximum of 25 posts within a 24-hour period ([see: Instagram Content Limitations](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/instagram-api/guides/content-publishing#limitations)). | Please wait before publishing additional posts. | | | *"Oops! The size of the attached media is a bit too large, or it is too long if it's a video. Please remove the attached media, upload a smaller-sized one, then retry."* | The image exceeded Instagram’s maximum file size of 8MB. | We recommend resizing the image, re-uploading to Aitoearn, and trying to publish again. | | | *"Oh no! We're hitting an issue with our permission to post on your behalf. Please walk through the steps to reauthorize the Aitoearn app in Facebook, Grant Full Permission for All Pages, then retry this post."* | This error message indicates not all permissions were accepted when this Instagram channel was added. | We recommend viewing our guide on [Reauthorizing the connection between Aitoearn and Facebook or Instagram](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBEJQ2DJ2B7PCMYE3RR1JWC4) to see instructions on how to reauthorize.Please ensure that all profiles/pages and permissions are selected in Facebook > Edit settings view.

Aitoearn doesn't have permission to post on your behalf. Please try reauthorizing this account by clicking "refresh" under settings."* | This error message indicates not all permissions were accepted when this Instagram channel was added. | We recommend viewing our guide on [Reauthorizing the connection between Aitoearn and Facebook or Instagram](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBEJQ2DJ2B7PCMYE3RR1JWC4) to see instructions on how to reauthorize.Please ensure that all profiles/pages and permissions are selected in Facebook > ***Edit settings*** view. Once this is done, retry your post. | | *"Oops! Please edit the post - alter the copy/text, re-name the video file, and create a brand new post."* | This is going to happen when Instagram's anti-spam mechanism is triggered. Unfortunately, Instagram doesn't offer more insight as to why posts are failing. Therefore, we don't have a foolproof way of guaranteeing that this error won't pop up from time to time. | Typically, when this error does occur, our recommendation is to amend the post wherever possible. This could be by editing and changing the copy/text of the post, editing hashtags, removing links, re-uploading the media, and trying to publish the post again. - Copy the caption from the failed post. - Create a new post and paste caption in. - Rename the video file to something like **video1**. - Upload the newly renamed video to the newly created post. - Try sending out the new post and delete the failed one. | | | *"Error: Oops! A timeout occurred while downloading the media. Please create a new post and re-upload the attached media"* | Facebook’s servers are sending us back a `-2` error, which means that it's taking too long to download the media attached to the post and the download timed out as a result. | - Copy the caption from the failed post. - Create a new post and paste caption in. - Rename the video file to something like **video1**. - Upload the newly renamed video to the newly created post. - Try sending out the new post, and delete the failed one. | | | *"Error: Oops! Instagram is limiting this post from being published. Please edit the post content and try again."* | This error usually appears because Instagram has put a temporary hold on both the account you're posting to and a hold on using the API to send posts to Instagram. This might be due to one (or a combination) of the following things: - Too many hashtags - Too many @ mentions - Repeated use of same hashtags and same @ mentions across multiple posts - Location data is incorrect - Included URL links in the caption | - Create a New Post in Aitoearn. - If including hashtags, reduce the number of hashtags and include fresh hashtags. - Check to make sure your post does not include a URL in the caption or first comment, as Instagram considers this spam content. - Please wait 24 hours and then attempt to publish the update again. | | | *"Whoops! We couldn't find any Instagram accounts connected to that Facebook account."* | This error occurs when we're missing certain permissions in the Facebook page that's connected to Instagram. | Please [double check that your Facebook account is set to Admin of the Facebook page that's linked to Instagram. ](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-troubleshooting-facebook-and-instagram-connections#h_01HBE587FX3S5P0NSY4ME069Q3) | | | *“It looks like you’re currently on a Instagram Creator account.
