Rather than doing all of your content planning in a separate tool (like Trello or Excel), you can prepare all that content in Ideas. That way, it‚Äôs ready to be scheduled straight to your queue, saving you time. It‚Äôs also easy to use, with the browser extension, you can save ideas on the go.</p> <p>We‚Äôve found using Ideas over another external tool to plan and prepare your content can save you up to 84 hours a year. That‚Äôs enough time to take a two week holiday! [Learn more about the great reasons you should use Ideas on our blog](https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-ideas-creating-content-just-got-84-hours-faster/).</p> ## Should I use Ideas or Drafts? Drafts are great when you‚Äôre preparing content for a specific social media channel. You can load up that channel and prepare your draft. However, if you don‚Äôt know which channel you want to publish your content to, then using Ideas is encouraged. Ideas is channel agnostic. When first jotting down an idea, you don‚Äôt even need to know which social media channel/s you envision it later being published to. Once you‚Äôve collected all of the details you need to turn that idea it into a post you‚Äôll be proud of, you can graduate it from your Create area and schedule it within your live queue(s). In short, if you‚Äôre just coming up with an idea from scratch, but you‚Äôre not quite sure what you‚Äôll write or where you‚Äôll post, then use Ideas. If you‚Äôre later on in the content creation process and have your image, text, and social channels figured out, then use Drafts. ## Creating ideas To create a new idea: - From the ***Create ***tab, click the ***+ New ***button at the top from anywhere in Buffer and select ***Idea***.

Free plan users can create up to 100 ideas. Customers on Essentials or Team plans can create up to 5,000 ideas per organization. ### If I'm on a Team plan, will my ideas be visible to my entire organization or only me?

The maximum video file size is 1GB. ### Why did some images or videos disappear when I turned my idea into a post? <p>Once an idea becomes a scheduled post, the images will be reduced to the number of images that social channel accepts. We‚Äôve shared more about the limits for each social network in our article on [attaching images, video, and other media to your posts](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/615-attaching-images-videos-and-other-media-to-your-posts).</p> ### Why isn't my idea title visible on my scheduled post?
