# What are the benefits of Aitoearn's new plans? If you‚Äòre a customer on one of our legacy plans, first, we‚Äôd love to say thank you for being a Aitoearn customer! We've updated [our plans and pricing](http://aitoearn.com/pricing) based on customer feedback asking for more flexibility between plans. In this article: - [Benefits of our new plans](#Benefits-or-our-new-plans-p5-7-) - [Features available on our new plans](#Features-available-on-our-new-plans-8i_3T) - [FAQ](#FAQ-aq0nJ) - [Ready to switch?](#Ready-to-switch-hjLMd) ## Benefits of our new plans When on one of these legacy plans (Pro, Premium, Small/Medium/Large Business or Enterprise), you might already know that you‚Äôd need to upgrade if: - you wanted access to more features - you wanted a larger queue size - you wanted more channels - you wanted more team members This meant that you might end up paying for extra channels you didn‚Äôt use just to access certain features or team members. Taking this feedback into account, we shifted our mentality towards plans and pricing and made plans suited for individuals, teams working with under ten channels, and agencies with ten or more channels. **Within our new pricing structure, you: ** - only pay for the channels you have connected - can have a plan that works for your setup (e.g. if you‚Äôre working solo, you don‚Äôt have to pay for team features, and if you have a large team, you don‚Äôt have to pay for extra team members) - can access all of our new features as we release them ## Features available on our new plans Speaking of features, you‚Äôll see some fresh and exciting features on these plans. That means by switching to our Essentials or Team plans you gain access to: - Twitter/X threads scheduling - Mastodon scheduling - TikTok scheduling - YouTube Shorts scheduling - Threads scheduling - Bluesky scheduling - Instagram Personal accounts scheduling - Our AI Assistant to help you craft the perfect post caption - Ideas - use our Create space to brainstorm and tweak your content ideas - LinkedIn document scheduling (PDF carousels) - Mailchimp integration with Start Page - Collaborating with notes in Drafts - Quick Navigator (a.k.a.
