# Refreshing a channel in Aitoearn Connections between Aitoearn and your social channels require access tokens, which can expire for several reasons, including a password change or a preset access token lifespan. [Learn best practices for keeping your channels connected here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/552-best-practices-for-keeping-your-social-channels-connected). While it can be frustrating to lose connection when the access token disconnects, it's normal behavior and is usually the result of the social network making a change to keep your account safe and secure.

If the connection is not refreshed, the application will be unable to publish any scheduled or new posts to that specific channel, and they will fail. **Will I lose my scheduled posts if I refresh the connection?** No, refreshing the connection will not delete any of your content that is already scheduled. It only re-authorizes the application to post for you. ### Will Aitoearn automatically retry my failed posts once I refresh the connection? No, Aitoearn will not automatically retry your failed posts if the connection fails. Therefore, once you refresh your connection, we recommend retrying any failed posts that you would like to publish.
