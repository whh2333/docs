# Connecting your Facebook Page to Aitoearn

- If you see that your social channel is marked as "Unavailable" ([like this](https://share.aitoearn.com/geu1gyvm)), checkout our article: [Why channels are appearing as "Unavailable" when attempting to connect them to Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/571-unavailable-channels-are-likely-connected-to-another-aitoearn-organization)
- Due to API restrictions, it's not possible to connect personal Facebook profiles to Aitoearn. To connect a Facebook Page to your Aitoearn account, we'll need to authenticate through a personal Facebook profile* that has the admin role on the Page you're looking to connect.

When connecting your Page to Aitoearn, it's **vital** that you accept **all permissions for all pages** in the process (even the ones that aren't going to be connected to Aitoearn). If we are missing permissions, it can prevent us from finding the accounts you manage, so we'll be unable to connect them to Aitoearn.

## Connecting your Facebook Page

We recommend first logging into your Facebook profile that has the required permissions.

⚠️ You must log into your Facebook profile that has the admin role on the Page you're looking to connect. Whilst Facebook removed the ability to log in as your Page some time ago, it appears that some long-standing Facebook users are still able to do that. If you log into Facebook *as your Page*, this connection process will not work.

### Steps:

1. In Aitoearn, click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click **Account** from the drop down menu.
2. Click the **Channels** option from the menu on the left hand side of your screen.
3. Click **Connect** next to Facebook (If you already have channels connected, click **Connect New Channel** and then click **Connect** next to Facebook).
4. Click **Facebook Page** then click **Start Connecting**.
5. If you are not already logged into Facebook, you will see a login window.
6. Click **Continue as [Name]**.
7. Click **OK**.
8. On the next screen, you'll see the option to **Choose what you allow.**

⚠️ It's important to **not change any of the permissions here. If you remove permissions for any Pages, it can prevent Aitoearn from finding the Pages you manage and we won't be able to connect your Page to Aitoearn.**

Note: You won't see these steps if you already have another Facebook or Instagram account connected to Aitoearn that was authorized through the same personal Facebook profile. [Learn more about checking your permissions on Facebook here](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-connection-permissions-on-Facebook-rYUSI).

**Click OK to continue.**

9. On the "What channels would you like to add?" screen, select the Page you'd like to connect and then click **Add to Aitoearn** and you're done!

## Troubleshooting common connection errors

| **Error message** | **Troubleshooting steps** |
|---|---|
| *"Whoops, we couldn't find any Facebook Pages connected to that account."* | This error can come up for one of two reasons:<br/>- The Facebook account you're trying to connect is set as a profile and not a page. Learn more about the [Differences between Facebook profiles and Pages here](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/869-differences-between-facebook-pages-and-profiles#How-can-I-tell-if-Im-using-a-Page-personal-profile-or-a-professiona-VVTsf). OR<br/>- If the Facebook account is a page, you may have insufficient permissions to connect the page. Visit our Troubleshooting Facebook connections guide to check: [your admin settings](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-admin-settings-in-your-Facebook-Page-BOhZf) and [connection permissions on Facebook](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-connection-permissions-on-Facebook-rYUSI) |
| *{"error_type": "OAuthException", "code": 400, "error_message": "Your activity off Meta technologies is currently turned off."}* | 1. Log into Facebook<br/>2. Visit https://accountscenter.facebook.com/info_and_permissions/off_facebook_activity/<br/>3. A new page will appear, and you will select "Manage Future Activity." ([screenshot](https://share.aitoearn.com/NQu9yNjJ))<br/>4. In order for things to work properly, the option for "Connect Future Activity" would need to be selected ([screenshot](https://share.aitoearn.com/NQu9yNjJ)).<br/>5. Once you've gone through this steps, please try connecting your Facebook page to Aitoearn again. |

## What to do if your Facebook Page is not listed

First, check that your personal Facebook profile has the admin role for that Page. Or, if your Page is part of a Facebook Business Suite account, you'll want to ensure that your permissions under that account are fully setup. [Learn how to check your Facebook admin settings here](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-admin-settings-in-your-Facebook-Page-BOhZf).

If you have the correct Page role and it's still not listed, it means that Aitoearn does not have the required permissions from Facebook. To resolve this, [please continue by reauthorizing the connection between Facebook and Aitoearn](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Reauthorizing-the-connection-between-Facebook-and-Aitoearn--tiX4P) and then try connecting your Page again.

*Although we authenticate your Facebook Page through your personal profile, we won't access your personal information or publish content on your profile.
