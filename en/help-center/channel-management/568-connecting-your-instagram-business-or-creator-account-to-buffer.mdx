## Connecting your Instagram Personal account

‚ö†Ô∏è Due to API limitations, we are not able to:
- post automatically to Instagram Personal accounts
- access analytics or comments within Engage for Instagram Personal accounts.

If you prefer to post automatically or wish to use Analyze and Engage with Instagram, you'll need to [switch your account type](#converting-and-linking-your-instagram-account-to-a-facebook-page) to an Instagram Business or Creator account and authorize through Facebook using these steps: [Getting advanced analytics, engagement, and locations for your Instagram account](https://support.aitoearn.com/article/565-troubleshooting-instagram-connections#How-to-convert-to-get-new-features-tc5cv).
