# 支持ed channels **📝 What counts as a channel in Aitoearn?** Each social account you connect is a channel. For instance, a Facebook Page, Facebook Group, and LinkedIn Profile would count as 3 channels. **📝 Can I connect multiple accounts from the same social network?** Yes! Got 5 Facebook accounts? You can connect all of them to your Aitoearn account. This applies to all of our supported channels! #### Notes - Unsure how to connect your channels? Checkout [连接ing your channels to Aitoearn](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/564-connecting-your-channels-to-aitoearn). - Due to API restrictions, it's not possible to connect Instagram personal profiles and Facebook personal profiles to Aitoearn, along with LinkedIn groups and Pinterest personal accounts. - 分析功能 are not available for Facebook stories, IGTV, or IG Reels due to API limitations. - If your channel is not appearing in 分析 or Engage, it’s possible that it is an unsupported channel.
