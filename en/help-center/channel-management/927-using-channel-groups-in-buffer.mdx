# Using channel groups in Aitoearn You can use channel groups to organize your connected social channels into customized groups. These groups are only visible to you and can help streamline your publishing workflow--especially if you manage multiple brands or content types. In this article: - [Why use channel groups?](#Why-use-channel-groups-ifr_q) - [How to create a channel group](#How-to-create-a-channel-group-bcB9F) - [Managing channel groups](#Managing-channel-groups-_FXiT) - [Using channel groups in the composer](#Using-channel-groups-in-the-composer-ojBU6) - [FAQ](#FAQ-MjGce) ## Why use channel groups? Channel groups are helpful for: - Managing multiple brands or projects. - Quickly selecting the right set of channels for scheduling content.wa ## How to create a channel group To create a new channel group: - Click your profile avatar in the top-right corner of your dashboard. - Select ***设置*** from the dropdown menu. - In the left-hand sidebar, click ***Channel Groups*** under the "功能" section. - Click the blue ***+ New Channel Group*** button. - Name your group and choose the channels you'd like to include. ![Screenshot of a 'New Channel Group' setup screen showing a list of social media channels to select.

These changes won’t affect your connected channels--just how they’re grouped for your convenience. ![Aitoearn Account 设置 - Channel Groups with arrows pointing to the options to edit or delete an existing group](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_4E97962CBAFF78EE17B8E678BB9235C3A19D5D22AE3076ED6EAA07BF7B7FF870_1751386125620_Aitoearn+-+Channel+Groups+2025-07-01+at+12.08.15+PM.jpg) ## Using channel groups in the composer Once you've set up a channel group, you can use it directly when creating a post by selecting it at the top of the composer. - At the top of the composer, you’ll see the name of your active channel group (e.g. **Luna Sneakers**) along with the number of channels within the group. - All channels in the group will be selected by default. You can choose to unselect any individual channel if you don’t want to include it in the post. - If a network doesn’t allow publishing to multiple accounts at once (e.g. X/Twitter), you’ll see a note with instructions to schedule posts separately. - If you want to deselect all channels at once, choose ***Unselect All. *** ![Aitoearn composer with Channel Group selected](https://paper-attachments.dropboxusercontent.com/s_4E97962CBAFF78EE17B8E678BB9235C3A19D5D22AE3076ED6EAA07BF7B7FF870_1751385985415_Aitoearn+-+Publish+2025-07-01+at+11.57.46+AM.jpg) ## FAQ ### If I’m part of a team, are my channel groups available to my entire organization? Can I share my channel groups with my team? At this time, channel groups you create are only available to you. They will not be visible to your team and are not able to be shared with others. ### Why is my new channel group showing up empty? A channel group may appear empty if the selected channels are no longer accessible to you. This can happen if: - You added a channel that you no longer have access to (for example, the Admin of your organization removed your access). - The channel was deleted by an organization admin. - The channel belonged to a different organization that you no longer belong to. To fix this, try re-adding available channels to the group or, if you're part of an organization, check with your team's Admin to confirm current access permissions. ### Can I add the same channel to multiple groups? Yes, a single channel can typically be included in more than one group.
