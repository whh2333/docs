# Why isn't my social channel name or profile image updating? Each time Aitoearn gets ready to publish a new post, it verifies the social channel name and profile image. If you’ve recently edited either of those, you may not see the change reflected in your dashboard until the next time a post is scheduled to be published. At that point, we will identify the change and all channel details should then be updated. This includes your [Instagram Shop Grid](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/590-instagram-shop-grid) as well. If this doesn’t update, you may need to [refresh the channel](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn).
