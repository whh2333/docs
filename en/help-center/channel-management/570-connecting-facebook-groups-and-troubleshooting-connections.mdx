# Connecting and publishing to your Facebook Group with Aitoearn Aitoearn supports posting to Facebook Groups with [notification publishing](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/658-using-notification-publishing). It is no longer possible to schedule posts to be sent automatically due to changes [Meta made to their Facebook Groups API in April 2024](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/changelog/version19.0). With notification based publishing, you can create your post in Aitoearn, receive a notification on your mobile device when it’s time to post, then tap the notification and copy your post over to your Facebook group to finish posting. [Learn more about how this works here](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders). Because we’re not posting automatically for you, the connection process for Facebook groups is slightly different than other channels and you will need to download the Aitoearn mobile app to finish posting. This guide will walk you through the steps to connect your group to Aitoearn and share some good to knows when using notification publishing. - [Connecting your Facebook Group ](#Connecting-your-Facebook-Group-6hToH) - [Publishing your post](#Publishing-your-post-Hr-tT) - [FAQ](#FAQ-ag9wn) ## Connecting your Facebook Group - First, open the Facebook group you want to connect to Aitoearn and copy its URL (you’ll need this later!)

Meta's API does not support automatic posting to Facebook groups. Therefore, we use notification publishing to post your content, which requires the latest version of the Aitoearn app (available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aitoearn-plan-schedule-posts/id490474324) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aitoearn.android)). ### If I have notifications set up for Instagram within the Aitoearn mobile app, do I need to set up notifications for Facebook groups too? Notifications within the Aitoearn app are channel specific, so you’ll still need to set up notifications for Facebook even if you’ve set up notifications for Instagram. ### What happens if I schedule the same post for a Facebook page and a Facebook group? Facebook pages and groups are still linked in the composer, so if you schedule a post for a Facebook group and a Facebook page, the Facebook page post will get scheduled to publish automatically and the Facebook group post will be scheduled as a notification.
