# Connecting or refreshing channels as a user of an organization In order to connect or refresh channels as a user of an organization, your account will need to be granted Admin access within Aitoearn. [Learn more about user permissions and access here](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC).

You may choose to connect your own channels to the publishing tool under the Aitoearn Free plan. In this case, when connecting or refreshing a channel, **it’s important to make sure you're working within the right organization**. To see your organizations, click the drop arrow next to your profile avatar to open the menu. From there, select the correct organization. Once selected, your dashboard will refresh and those channels will now be accessible to you. ![A picture of the upper right Aitoearn dashboard showing an organization list](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65149919f8eafb48f4e81327/img-1703224-1695848728-1002742817.png) After you’ve selected the correct organization, you can now [connect](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/564-connecting-your-channels-to-aitoearn) or [refresh](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn) the social channels. ## Locked channels or losing access to Aitoearn tools If you notice that some of the channels you have access to have been locked, this is likely because the owner of the organization downgraded their account: [What happens when you downgrade to the Free plan](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/597-what-happens-when-you-downgrade-to-the-free-plan). When a plan is downgraded, the account is moved to the Free plan with access to only three social channels and no additional users. This is the reason those channels become locked for you. In this case, you should chat with the organization owner and see if they had intentionally downgraded the account. It’s possible they didn’t know that downgrading their account would stop you from being able to access those channels or tools. ## FAQ ### Why can't I see my team's channels to refresh them?
