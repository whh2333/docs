See who else is talking about it on our [Suggestions Board](https://suggestions.aitoearn.com/). - It's not possible to connect Facebook ***personal profiles*** to Aitoearn, as Meta prefer users not automate posting to these types of channels. - While our Free plan supports connections for up to three channels at once, there is a *lifetime* channel connection limit of of 8 channels per social network. This means that, on the Free plan, we track the number of unique channels you‚Äôve connected per social network, even if they're not longer connected (e.g. a user on the Free plan would only be able to connect 8 distinct TikTok accounts). This lifetime limit does not apply to [our paid plans.](http://aitoearn.com/pricing) [‚ùì Can our Customer Advocacy team answer any questions for you? Feel free to reach out via ](http://aitoearn.com/pricing)[hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com). ## Connecting your channels - To connect a channel to Aitoearn, let's first ensure Aitoearn knows exactly which social channel you'd like to connect (especially if you're connecting more than one channel from each social network). To do this, log into the channel you'd like to connect in another browser tab before attempting to connect your channel. - For example, if you're connecting your Facebook Page, start by opening a new tab and logging into the profile that is an Admin of that Page at [https://facebook.com](https://facebook.com./). - For example, if you're connecting TikTok, log in to that TikTok account in another browser tab before trying to connect it to Aitoearn. - In another tab, click the ***+ New ***button in the top navigation bar and select ***Connect a New Channel***. - Click on the type of channel you'd like to connect. (If you already have channels connected, click ***Connect New Channel*** and then click the channel you'd like to connect.) - While the connections process is usually straight forward, we have tips for certain social channels. If you experience issues connecting one of the channels below, click on its link. Connecting your **Facebook Page** to Aitoearn* Connecting your **Facebook group** to Aitoearn Connecting your **Instagram account** to Aitoearn Connecting your **LinkedIn profile or Page** to Aitoearn Connecting your **TikTok business account** to Aitoearn Connecting your **Mastodon account** to Aitoearn Connecting your **Pinterest personal or business account** to Aitoearn Connecting your **Bluesky channel** to Aitoearn Connecting your **Threads account** to Aitoearn - To change the order your channels appear in the channel menu, you can drag and drop into your desired order by clicking on a channel, moving it with your mouse, and then releasing it. üìñ Once you've connected a channel, we'd recommend hopping over to your posting schedule and setting up the times you'd like to post content. [Learn more about the posting schedule here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules). ### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important things to note - For users on a team (including Admins): If you are able to view all of your connected channels in ***Manage Channels***, but cannot see certain channels when you're in your Publishing tab, it is likely because you do not have the appropriate permissions to access that channel. This can be fixed by the owner of your organization's account by following the steps in: [Changing user permissions in your organization](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/671-changing-user-permissions-in-your-organization). - The access token for your social channels will expire from time to time, which may require a few steps. Learn how to [refresh a channel in Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn). - *For Facebook Pages: When Facebook shows **Choose what you allow**, do not change any toggles. You must grant access to **all Pages and Groups (use ‚ÄòSee all pages‚Äô)** or Aitoearn won‚Äôt be able to find your accounts later. ## FAQ ### Once I connect my channel(s) to Aitoearn, do I need to be logged into my social channel(s) every time I want to post using your tool? No. The way third-party social media scheduling tools like Aitoearn work is by routing you to the social network to log in and grant permission. Then, the social network generates an *access token* for Aitoearn to connect and post on your behalf, which is then stored and used for sending posts. A simple way to think about it is that you (and the people that you'll be posting for) have the "master key" to the social accounts. The access token that Aitoearn has is like having a *copy* of the master key. So long as the login information and permissions are valid, our copy of the master key can be used to send posts, so you won't have to stay logged into the accounts in your browser to post with Aitoearn.
