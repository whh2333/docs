This happens when it is linked to your Facebook page as described [in the next section below](#Checking-the-link-between-Facebook-and-Instagram-wPHUz). **Not sure what type of account you have or how to convert it? See the **<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/554-using-instagram-with-buffer#Finding-your-Instagram-account-type-x-zBM" target="_blank">**steps in our Instagram Connection guide**</a>**.**</p> </div> <h3 id="Checking-the-link-between-Facebook-and-Instagram-wPHUz">**Checking the link between Facebook and Instagram**</h3> Instagram needs to be linked to its own Facebook Page (not a personal account). Please check within Facebook to make sure that your Instagram account is properly linked to a Facebook Page with these steps. **Note: This is not the same as linking it in your Meta Account Center**. - Log into Facebook on your computer. - Click your avatar in the top right-hand corner then click <b>*See all profiles*</b>. [Here‚Äôs what that looks like](https://share.buffer.com/04unABEK).</li> - Click on the Page you want to work with. If you don‚Äôt see your Page, [please see this guide](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/869-differences-between-facebook-pages-and-profiles).</li> - Now [go to this ](https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=linked_instagram)screen to see if Instagram is linked to the Page. Here‚Äôs an example of how it should look if it is successfully connected ([s](https://share.buffer.com/P8uXAWnG)[creenshot](https://share.buffer.com/wbuqxADD)). - If you see any errors about admin access, [please see the next section](#Checking-your-admin-settings--Vr3Zx).</li> - If you see any other alert, such [as](https://share.buffer.com/geuKObKk)[ ](https://share.buffer.com/geuKObKk)[‚ÄúReview](https://share.buffer.com/geuKObKk)[ Connection‚Äù](https://share.buffer.com/geuKObKk), please read and follow the prompts. </li> </li> - If your Instagram is not linked and you [see this screen](https://share.buffer.com/6qu1N8W8), click <b>*Connect account*</b> to link your Instagram to your Facebook Page (this will convert it to a Professional account if it is a Personal account).</li> <h3 id="Checking-your-admin-settings--Vr3Zx">**Checking your admin settings **</h3> In order to connect or refresh your Facebook Page in Buffer, you‚Äôll first need to be set up as an admin of the Facebook Page with **Full Control**. This is also necessary to review Instagram connections in Facebook. Because your Admin settings and permissions are controlled in your Facebook account and they control your Pages and Portfolios, please head to [this section](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-admin-settings-in-your-Facebook-Page-BOhZf) of our Facebook Admin guide to walk through those steps. <h3 id="Reauthorizing-the-connection-between-Facebook-and-Buffer--Xou2T">**Reauthorizing the connection between Facebook and Buffer **</h3> Sometimes the authorization access token between Buffer and Facebook needs to be renewed in order to get things to work properly. This can happen for a number of reasons, such as if you have not chosen the right permissions during the connection process or you have connected a Facebook or Instagram account in the past. If everything else looks to be in place, give these steps a try by heading to [this section](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Reauthorizing-the-connection-between-Facebook-and-Buffer--tiX4P) of the Facebook guide. <div class="callout"> <p>Still having trouble?
