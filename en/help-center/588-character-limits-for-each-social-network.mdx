The table below outlines the character limit for each social channel.</p> <table class="hs-table"> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Channel</strong></td> <td><strong>Character limit</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Facebook pages &amp; groups</td> <td><p>5,000 for post/reel captions</p><p>5,000 for first comments</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Instagram accounts</td> <td><p>2,200 for post/reel captions</p><p>2,196 for first comments</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>X/Twitter profiles</td> <td><p>X Free users: 280 characters</p><p>X Basic, Premium and Premium + users: 25,000 characters*</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>LinkedIn pages &amp; profiles</td> <td><p>3,000 for posts</p><p>1,248 for first comments</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pinterest boards</td> <td>500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>TikTok Business accounts</td> <td>2,200</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Start Pages</td> <td>5,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Mastodon accounts</td> <td>500</td> </tr> <tr> <td>YouTube Shorts</td> <td>5,000</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Threads</td> <td><p>500 for posts</p><p>50 for topics</p></td> </tr> <tr> <td>Bluesky</td> <td>300</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Google Business Profiles</td> <td>1500</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="callout-blue"> <h3 id="h_01HAPSR01Y8EWT8W2JZNYNJX7Y">üìù Notes</h3> <ul> <li>*Extended character counts for paid X users are available on our Free, Essentials, and Team plans.

If the character count goes down when you add an image (as it does for X/Twitter and LinkedIn), this is a social network that factors images into your character count allotment.</li> <li>When mentioning users on Mastodon (e.g. @jane@exampleserver.com), only the username (e.g. "jane") will count against your character limit ‚Äì the domain is not counted (e.g. @exampleserver.com).</li> <li></li><p>It's possible that when posting natively, the character limit is higher. That is because some of the limits imposed by a social network's API** are stricter than those imposed on the native platform.</p><br /><p><em>**What is an API? </em>It's the access that one application (in this case, a social network) gives to another application (in this case, Buffer or any other third-party).</p></li> </ul> </div> </article>
