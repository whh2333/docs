When the post is published, the hashtags on Facebook, X/Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Mastodon, and YouTube posts will hyperlink just as if they were sent from the native platform itself.</p> <p>Pinterest does not hyperlink hashtags, so hashtags sent to Pinterest will not be clickable.</p> <p>Threads supports use of only one hashtag per post, referred to as "Topics." You will be able to create hashtags with the # symbol and then once posted, the first hashtag is converted into a topic. All subsequent hashtags appear as plain text. Hashtags/Topics can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, but cannot contain just numbers.</p> <h2 id="01G23C6K7CBG2Q20R1B36QB3PK">Using Buffer's hashtag manager</h2> <div class="callout-red"> <p>⭐️ This feature is on our&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-buffer-plan" target="_blank">paid plans</a>.</p> </div> <p>If you're on any of our paid plans, you'll have access to the hashtag manager, allowing you to create groups of hashtags to quickly insert into the caption of any post you send to any social account through Buffer.</p> <p>There is no autocomplete functionality within the hashtag manager, so it'll be important to double-check that all of your hashtags are spelled as you'd like them to be.
