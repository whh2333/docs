If the tags don‚Äôt exist, Buffer will import the post but ignore the tags. ### Image troubleshooting checklist If your image doesn‚Äôt show up after uploading your CSV file, check the following: <li></li><p>‚úÖ **Does the URL end in a file extension?**</p><p>Make sure the link ends with `.jpg` , `.jpeg` , `.png` , or [one of the formats listed above](https://secure.helpscout.net/docs/64cb6d9c0a5b99723c9358af/article/68654e14b577ac399a510f15#How-to-get-a-direct-image-URL-from-popular-hosting-services-9SMjx).</p></li> <li></li><p>‚úÖ **Is the file publicly accessible?**</p><p>Double-check that link sharing is set to **public** or **anyone with the link**. Private links won‚Äôt display in your posts.</p></li> <li></li><p>‚úÖ **Is the link a direct image URL?**</p> Right-click the link and try to open it in a new browser tab. If the image displays by itself (not inside a webpage), you have the right type of link. </li> <li></li><p>‚úÖ **Is the image too large?**</p> Very large images (over 5MB) may fail to load. Try resizing or compressing before re-uploading. </li> <li></li><p>‚úÖ **Is the hosting service supported?**</p> Stick with widely used hosts (Google Drive, Dropbox, Imgur or your own website). Some services, like Facebook or Instagram, don‚Äôt provide usable direct URLs. </li> If you‚Äôve checked all the above and your image still won‚Äôt display, try a different hosting service to confirm whether the issue is with the file or the link. ## FAQ ### Is there a limit to the number of posts I can upload at one time? <p>Yes, you can bulk upload up to 100 posts at once if you're on [our paid plans](http://buffer.com/pricing).</p> If you're on a Free plan, the maximum number of posts you can upload in bulk is 10 posts per channel. However, you'll only be able to upload as many posts as you have free slots in your queue. - For example, if you already have 3 posts scheduled for your Facebook Page, you can upload up to 7 more posts for that channel.
