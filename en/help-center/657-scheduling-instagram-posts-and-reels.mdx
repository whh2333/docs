        <p>When you're using Buffer to publish to Instagram, you can either publish automatically to Instagram or set a notification to finish the post in the Instagram app yourself. This applies to reels and stories, too.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053">Learn more about how to use notification based publishing for Instagram here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="Automatic-vs-notification-publishing---which-is-right-for-my-post-21sNu">Automatic vs. notification publishing - which is right for my post?</h2>
<div>
 Certain features (like scheduling a first comment) are available when publishing automatically to Instagram Professional accounts, while others (like adding music to a reel or stickers to a story) can only be added if you are scheduling to an Instagram Personal account or you set a notification and finish the post yourself on Instagram. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/554-using-instagram-with-buffer#h_01HB99SMK6389CZEMAG1XBP6K6">Learn more about how Buffer works on Instagram Personal accounts vs. Professional accounts here</a>.
</div>
<div>
 Every time you create a post, story, or reel in Buffer, you can choose one of the following options:
</div>
<div>
 <b>Automatic publishing</b>
</div>
<div>
 Set it and forget it. Buffer will automatically post on your behalf so that you can focus on other things, like replying to comments or creating new content.
</div>
<div>
 <b>Notification publishing</b>
</div>
<div>
 Add story stickers, music, product tags, story links, and enjoy more creative control. Buffer will set up your post, send you a notification, and help you finish the post yourself on Instagram.
</div>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>If the image or video within your post falls outside of <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/622-instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges">Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges</a>, it cannot be scheduled for automatic publishing and will be scheduled as a notification instead.</p>

  <li>Instagram recently began introducing a new version of the grid which features a taller format <i>displaying </i>images at 3:4, however, the images still need to be <i>uploaded</i> at 4:5 in both Buffer and Instagram. While the image upload displayed in Buffer’s&nbsp;<i>composer, calendar, and queue</i>&nbsp;will display in 1:1 format, the <i>post preview</i> to the right of the composer will always show the correct format (4:5).</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h2 id="01H7G1SZ6VRWNEKE8VK4AQGP15">Creating your Instagram post, reel, or story&nbsp;</h2>
<ol>
 <li>To get started, select your Instagram account on the left-hand side of your dashboard.</li>
 <li>Open the composer at the top of your queue.</li>
 <li>Choose to schedule your post as a&nbsp;<em><strong>Post</strong></em><em>,&nbsp;</em><em><strong>Reel</strong></em><em>,&nbsp;</em>or <em><strong>Story</strong></em><em>.</em></li>
</ol>

 <ul>
  <li>Videos must be 100 MB or smaller.</li>
  <li>Instagram creator accounts cannot schedule Instagram stories for automatic publishing. Instead, they'll need to be scheduled as a notification.</li>
  <li>Instagram carousel can only contain images at this time. Carousel posts do not support mixed media, meaning you will not be able to create a post containing both an image and video or a post containing multiple videos.</li>
  <li>For Instagram carousel posts (i.e. multiple images in one post), once the first photo is selected, all of the following photos selected will be cropped to the same aspect ratio. For example, if the first photo you select is square (1:1), all of your other images will be cropped to a 1:1 format. This is the same when posting to Instagram natively.</li>
  <li>If you are trying to schedule an Instagram story with multiple videos or images, you will need to schedule each image or video as a separate story in Buffer.</li>
  <li>If your image or video falls outside of&nbsp;<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360037965494">Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range</a>, it will get scheduled as a notification and will need to be posted manually.&nbsp;<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053">Learn more about how to finish publishing using notifications here.</a></li>

  <ul>
   <li><b>Note: </b>If you choose <b><i>Add Sticker </i></b>and select a feature that is not supported for automatic posting, such as <b><i>Music</i></b>, <b><i>Tag Product</i></b>, <b><i>Text, Link, </i></b>or <b><i>Topics</i></b> we'll switch your post to <b><i>Notify Me </i></b>so you'll get a notification and you can finish posting in Instagram. We'll also generate a text box for each Sticker so you can leave yourself a note about what music, text, story links, products or topics you want to add in the Instagram app when you finish publishing your post, reel, or story.</li>

  <li>Locations are only available for automatic publishing. For posts scheduled as notifications, the location field serves as a placeholder to remind you of the location you’d like to manually add when publishing the post directly in the Instagram app.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<p>If you'd like to add a location to your post or reel, start typing any location name or type the name of a Facebook Page you'd like to point to the location of.</p>

<p>User tagging is only available on posts published automatically. It’s not available for reels or stories.</p>
<ol>
 <li>After uploading an image to your post, click the&nbsp;<em><strong>Tag</strong></em>&nbsp;button on the image.</li>
 <li>Click the location on the image you’d like to add a tag, enter the @ handle and then click&nbsp;<em><strong>Add Tag</strong></em>.</li>

 <li>A link to the Instagram account will appear on the right hand side. You’re able to add up to 20 tags on an image for a single image post.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
 <li>For carousel posts, the tagged accounts in the image are carried over for each image in the carousel. When this happens, each image tag is added together for a total. If your draft has more than 20 tags, you may see an error and will need to edit the tags down for the carousel post to successfully publish.</li>
 <li>Please note: all tags in the first image automatically carry over to all other images in the carousel, counting towards the limit.</li>
 <li>If you need to remove a tag, click the&nbsp;<em><strong>x</strong></em>&nbsp;icon to the left of it on the right hand side. Once you’ve finished adding your tags, click&nbsp;<em><strong>Save</strong></em>&nbsp;and then continue scheduling your post as normal.</li>

 <h3>📝 Notes</h3>
 <ul>
  <li>Due to limitations in Instagram's API, we can't auto-complete the @ handle, and you will need to enter the exact @ handle of the Instagram user you’d like to mention.</li>
  <li>We would strongly encourage you to check each link on the right-hand side to make sure the correct @ handle has been entered.</li>
  <li>Posts with tags for private or non-existent users will fail.</li>

<h2 id="FAQ-g6ioI">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is it possible to hide the number of likes from Instagram posts or reels?</h3>
<p>No, at this time, it is not possible to hide the number of likes from your posts while scheduling your content in Buffer. To hide the number of likes on your post, you can view the published post on Instagram and use the <i><b>Hide Likes</b></i> feature on the post.</p>
<h3>Will Instagram posts sent through Buffer be automatically published to Facebook if I have this setting enabled within Instagram?</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, due to API limitations, Instagram posts that are published through Buffer will not automatically publish to Facebook, even if this setting is enabled on your Instagram account. To have an Instagram post automatically publish to Facebook, you would need to create the post directly on Instagram.</p>
<h3>Is it possible to move the position of my text or change the font of my Instagram story or reel?</h3>
<p>No, it is not possible to move the position of your Instagram text or change the font in Buffer. Due to API limitations, Buffer does not support editing the font or moving the text on the screen for Instagram Reels directly within the app. The preview you see in Buffer is just a guideline so you have an idea of what your text&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>look like.</p>
<p>To customize the font and position of your text, you'll need to do so within the Instagram app itself. You can schedule your Reel with Buffer using the&nbsp;<i><b>Notify Me</b></i>&nbsp;option, and when it's time to post, you'll receive a notification on your phone. You can then open Instagram and add your text, choosing the font and positioning it as you like.</p>
