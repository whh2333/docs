# Using notification publishing Notification publishing is process where you can prepare your post in Buffer, receive a notification on your mobile device when it’s time to post, then tap the notification and copy your post over to the social network to finish posting. When should you use notification publishing? - when you want to use features that aren’t supported via a social network’s API, like posting to a Facebook Group, or adding music to Instagram Reels or TikTok posts. - when Buffer can’t post due to technical reasons (e.g. when your image for Instagram falls outside of [the accepted aspect ratio range](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/622-instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges)). To publish using notifications, you'll need to grant Instagram access to **All Photos/Full Access** in your phone's settings and **download Buffer's mobile app **(available on [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/buffer-plan-schedule-posts/id490474324) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.buffer.android)). - Notification publishing is currently available for Instagram Accounts (Personal, Business, and Creator), TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook Groups. Notification publishing *is not *available for Facebook Pages, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastodon, Bluesky, Google Business Profiles, Pinterest, Start Pages, or Threads.
