To create an effective prompt, you can ask yourself a few questions:</p> <ul> <li></li><strong>Objective:</strong> What is the goal of the post? Are you promoting a product, sharing information, driving engagement, or something else?</li> <li></li><strong>Target Audience:</strong> Who are you writing for? Understanding your audience helps tailor the tone and style accordingly.&nbsp;</li> <li></li><strong>Content:</strong> Please provide the main idea you want to include in the post. It could be a specific message, a call-to-action, or any other specific details you'd like to share.</li> <li></li><strong>Keywords/Hashtags</strong>: Adding relevant keywords can improve visibility and engagement.</li> <li></li><strong>Tone and Style:</strong> How do you want your post to sound? For example, friendly, informative, formal, casual, etc.</li> <li></li><strong>CTA (Call-to-Action):</strong> If you want to direct the audience to a website, landing page, or any specific action, please provide the link or details in your prompt.</li> <li></li><strong>Platform:</strong> Which social media channel will this post be published on? Different platforms have different character limits and audience expectations. (Note: Buffer's AI assistant takes care of network customized prompts automatically once you've clicked <em><strong>Customize for each network </strong></em>in the composer)</li> </ul> <h2 id="h_01GS8G3FKDMZZC5C0N9TM5716T">Known limitations with AI</h2> <div> Buffer's AI Assistant currently utilizes GPT-4.0 technology from OpenAI to generate suggestions. While this cutting-edge AI can be incredibly helpful, it's important to be aware of its limitations. We strongly recommend reviewing and fact-checking all AI-generated content before posting. </div> <div> Please note that the content generated by our AI Assistant does not necessarily reflect Buffer's views, policies, or official stance on any topic. </div> <div> Key limitations to be aware of: </div> <ul> <li></li><b>Accuracy</b>: The AI may occasionally generate incorrect information about people, places, or facts.</li> <li></li><b>Hallucinations</b>: The AI can sometimes "hallucinate" or generate information that appears plausible but is entirely fabricated.</li> <li></li><b>Up-to-date knowledge</b>: The AI's knowledge is not real-time and may not include the most recent events or developments.</li> <li></li><b>Bias and harmful content</b>: In rare cases, the AI might produce biased content or potentially harmful instructions. If you encounter such content, please report it to us at <a href="mailto:hello@buffer.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">hello@buffer.com</a>.</li> <li></li><b>URL processing</b>: The AI cannot open, read, or directly access any URLs provided to it.</li> <li></li><b>Ethical considerations</b>: The AI doesn't have inherent ethical judgment. You should ensure AI-generated content aligns with your own ethical standards.</li> </ul> <div> By being aware of these limitations, you can make the most of our AI Assistant while ensuring your content is high-quality and accurate. Always use your judgment and expertise when reviewing AI-generated suggestions. </div><br /> <h2 id="FAQ-DlkU3">FAQ</h2> <h3>Which AI model does Buffer use?</h3> <p>Buffer's AI Assistant currently utilizes GPT-4.0 technology from OpenAI.</p> </article>
