# Connecting your Facebook Page to Buffer - If you see that your social channel is marked as "Unavailable" ([like this](https://share.buffer.com/geu1gyvm)), checkout our article: [Why channels are appearing as "Unavailable" when attempting to connect them to Buffer](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/571-unavailable-channels-are-likely-connected-to-another-buffer-organization) - Due to API restrictions, it's not possible to connect personal Facebook profiles to Buffer. To connect a Facebook Page to your Buffer account, we'll need to authenticate through a personal Facebook profile* that has the admin role on the Page you're looking to connect. Learn more about Facebook Page roles, including how Facebook Business Suite works, [here](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-admin-settings-in-your-Facebook-Page-BOhZf). When connecting your Page to Buffer, it's **vital** that you accept **all permissions for all pages **in the process (even the ones that aren't going to be connected to Buffer). If we are missing permissions, it can prevent us from finding the accounts you manage, so we'll be unable to connect them to Buffer.

Whilst Facebook removed the ability to log in as your Page some time ago, it appears that some long-standing Facebook users are still able to do that. If you log into Facebook *as your Page*, this connection process will not work. - In Buffer, click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click ***Account*** from the drop down menu. - Click the ***Channels*** option from the menu on the left hand side of your screen. - Click ***Connect ***next to Facebook (If you already have channels connected, click ***Connect New Channel*** and then click ***Connect ***next to Facebook). ![Buffer connect Facebook Page or Group button](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67e2d1670667114ad3f025cb/file-4GG51qdEZ4.jpg) - Click ***Facebook Page*** then click ***Start Connecting***. - If you are not already logged into Facebook, you will see a login window. - Click ***Continue as [Name]***. ![Facebook Page connection modal](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65149929556a3e3cf18cbfe8/img-1703224-1695848744-1623192212.png) - Click ***OK***. - On the next screen, you'll see the option to ***Choose what you allow. *** ⚠️ It's important to **not change any of the permissions here. If you remove permissions for any Pages, it can prevent Buffer from finding the Pages you manage and we won't be able to connect your Page to Buffer. ** - Note: You won't see these steps if you already have another Facebook or Instagram account connected to Buffer that was authorized through the same personal Facebook profile.

Or, if your Page is part of a Facebook Business Suite account, you'll want to ensure that your permissions under that account are fully setup. [Learn how to check your Facebook admin settings here](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Checking-your-admin-settings-in-your-Facebook-Page-BOhZf). If you have the correct Page role and it's still not listed, it means that Buffer does not have the required permissions from Facebook. To resolve this, [please continue by reauthorizing the connection between Facebook and Buffer](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide#Reauthorizing-the-connection-between-Facebook-and-Buffer--tiX4P) and then try connecting your Page again. **Although we authenticate your Facebook Page through your personal profile, we won't access your personal information or publish content on your profile.* ❓ Can our Customer Advocacy team answer any questions for you?
