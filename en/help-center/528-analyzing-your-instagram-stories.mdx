Due to API limitations, it's not possible to pull in stories that you have shared after being @mentioned in. Additionally, we are not able to backfill stories. We are only able to start collecting them from when your Instagram account is connected to Buffer and it may take up to 24 hours to show in your Buffer dashboard.</li> - If your Instagram account becomes disconnected from Buffer, any stories you post during the time that your Instagram account is disconnected will unfortunately not be pulled into Buffer. - If you are a customer in the EEA (European Economic Area) any Instagram stories you create will now see zero replies, even if those replies are from users outside of the EEA. If you are outside of the EEA, your stories will see a number of replies but it will exclude any replies from users in the EEA. This is due to new privacy rules in Europe that directly affect what Facebook and Instagram can show.

We'll show you impressions, reach, replies, exits and your engagement rate (replies received relative to unique Instagram accounts that viewed the story). ![Instagram stories summary in Buffer's analytics dashboard](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514995bf8eafb48f4e81341/img-1656503-1695848794-1287238376.png) ### Stories metrics insights This chart shows you the changes in your Instagram stories metrics, such as impressions, reach, and replies. Besides comparing the data with the previous period, you can also compare two metrics to see how they correlated. For example, do posting more stories correlate with higher reach? ![Instagram stories metrics breakdown in Buffer's analytics dashboard](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514995cf8eafb48f4e81342/img-1656503-1695848794-91284969.png) ### Stories insights <p>This chart shows your reach and completion rate for each Instagram story. By default, all stories shared within the date range chosen at the top of the report will be shown. If preferred, you can use the ***Show*** drop down to only show stories shared on a specific day.
