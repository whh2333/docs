Due to API limitations, it's not possible to pull in stories that you have shared after being @mentioned in. Additionally, we are not able to backfill stories. We are only able to start collecting them from when your Instagram account is connected to Buffer and it may take up to 24 hours to show in your Buffer dashboard.</li> <li>If your Instagram account becomes disconnected from Buffer, any stories you post during the time that your Instagram account is disconnected will unfortunately not be pulled into Buffer.</li> <li>If you are a customer in the EEA (European Economic Area) any Instagram stories you create will now see zero replies, even if those replies are from users outside of the EEA. If you are outside of the EEA, your stories will see a number of replies but it will exclude any replies from users in the EEA. This is due to new privacy rules in Europe that directly affect what Facebook and Instagram can show. </li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/384262082655927" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn more from Facebook here</a>.</li> </ul> </div> <h3 id="h_01HCN8F3Q5K6284QR2JJSE0ZHR">Stories summary table</h3> <p>The summary table shows aggregate metrics for all stories sent during the selected date range.
