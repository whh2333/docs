# Working with multiple Instagram accounts <a href="javascript:window.print()" class="printArticle" title="Print this article" aria-label="Print this Article"><i class="icon-print"></i></a> <p>If you’re managing multiple Instagram accounts and [using notification publishing](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/658-using-notification-publishing) for your posts, it’s important to make sure you’re posting to the correct account within the Instagram app. This guide will share tips and best practices for publishing to multiple Instagram accounts.</p> In this article: <li></li>[Logging into the correct Instagram account ](#Logging-into-the-correct-Instagram-account-fm-k_)</li> <li></li>[Managing more than five Instagram accounts](#Managing-more-than-five-Instagram-accounts-kE_O6)</li> ## Logging into the correct Instagram account When the notification comes through to your phone, the message will state which Instagram account the post is intended for. <p>Tapping the alert will bring you to a preview of your Instagram post within the Buffer mobile app. From there, tap ***Open in Instagram***. You'll then be prompted to check if you’re posting to the correct account. If you’re unsure, tap ***See who is logged on***. This will take you to the Instagram app where you can check which account you’re currently using.</p> ![Buffer mobile app Instagram reminder](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499dc556a3e3cf18cc027/img-1714411-1695848922-1561476440.png) Instagram allows you to connect five accounts per device, meaning you can easily switch between them without logging in and out each time. Once in Instagram, head to your profile and if you’re logged into multiple accounts you’ll be able to switch between them by tapping the account name at the top of the screen. <p>Once you have the right account selected, head back to the Buffer app and share your post as normal (you can do this by clicking ***< Buffer*** at the top left of the screen).</p> ## Managing more than five Instagram accounts Instagram has a limit of five active accounts per device, which means if you’re managing more than that, you will need to fully log out of each account and log back into the correct one that the post is intended for. One thing to note is that you would need to make sure Instagram is not "remembering" the login details for each account, otherwise it wouldn't let you login to a sixth account. <div class="callout-blue"> <p>**Note: **Constantly logging in and out of accounts, especially if it's from different IP addresses, can lead to Instagram raising security flags on these accounts, since this can be interpreted as suspicious activity. This can then result in frequently needing to reconnect your Instagram accounts to Buffer. We appreciate that this is time consuming and frustrating, and for this reason, we do not recommend managing more than five Instagram accounts if you’re likely to use notification publishing on a regular basis, as it’s very likely to lead to these types of issues.</p> </div>
