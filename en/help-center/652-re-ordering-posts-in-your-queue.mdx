# Re-ordering posts in your queue <a href="javascript:window.print()" class="printArticle" title="Print this article" aria-label="Print this Article"><i class="icon-print"></i></a> It is sometimes necessary to change the order of the posts in your queue. You can do this by dragging and dropping posts into the desired order, or if you feel like really shaking things up, you can use the Shuffle feature to mix up the order of the first 200 posts in your queue. <div class="callout-yellow"> <p>üé• Keen to learn more about [managing your queue](https://fast.wistia.net/embed/channel/nasetpeuf7?wchannelid=nasetpeuf7&wmediaid=ow99bmfwht)?</p> </div> In this article: <li></li>[Reordering posts using drag and drop](#h_01ERDHCTGGA588KTBKWG0HD722)</li> <li></li>[Shuffling your queue](#h_01ERDHDDB4R87P08MWE579DJ30)</li> ## Reordering posts using drag and drop Posts in your queue can be reordered using drag and drop. You can either drag and drop a post on top of another post to swap the order ("drap and swap"!), or you can drag and drop a post into an empty time slot in your queue. üìù Please note, it is not possible to move custom scheduled posts using drag and drop, since those posts are locked in place. ![Swapping posts int he queue](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66e45f83dd5b956281ae4cc9/file-AGU21C93KL.gif) ## Shuffling your queue <div class="callout-red"> <p>**‚≠êÔ∏è The Shuffle feature is available on our paid plans. **<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-buffer-plan" target="_self">**Learn more about our plans and pricing here**</a></p> </div> The Shuffle feature allows you to mix up the order of the first 200 posts in your queue. <div class="callout-blue"> <p>**Note:** you can only shuffle posts that are scheduled with the ***Add to Queue*** option.
