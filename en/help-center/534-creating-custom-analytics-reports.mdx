# Creating custom analytics reports in Buffer Analyze One of the key features of Buffer's analytics dashboard is the ability to create custom reports using any of the tables and charts available. There is no need to create a new report each week or month since each time you view the report, you can choose the new date range you’d like to analyze. ⭐️ This feature is on our [paid plans](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-buffer-plan).

By creating a custom report, you can: - Assess the performance of your content across different social media channels. - Generate and download performance reports to share with stakeholders. - Track key metrics for your social media accounts including Facebook pages, Instagram professional accounts, Twitter/X accounts, and LinkedIn pages. ## Adding tables and charts to reports Once in the Analytics tab ([https://analyze.buffer.com/](https://analyze.buffer.com/)), you can add any of the charts and tables found within any of the tabs to a custom report by clicking the plus (+) button. ![Buffer Analyze with arrows pointing to the + (add to report) button](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880f19ec11e7d145471920e/file-lWZ1xBb4m1.png) To create a new report, enter the name you’d like to use and then click *Create Report*. Alternatively, add the table or chart to an existing report by clicking on the report name. ![Create a new report by entering a title and clicking create report or select an existing report.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/64d24f7517822902c5ab907b/file-DljXihkqPF.png) 📝 Please note, after clicking *Create Report* or an existing report, you *won’t* be taken to the report. The window will close, allowing you to add other charts and tables if you’d like to. ## Viewing and customizing reports To view your reports, select the *Reports* tab on the left hand side of your dashboard. You’ll see a list of all available reports. Simply click on the report you’d like to view. 📝 The timezone of each report you create is in UTC. At the top right of the report, you’re able to change the date range you’d like to analyze. The beauty of this is that you don’t need to create new reports each week or month; you can simply use the same report and customize the date range. ![Buffer Analyze report with custom date range selector open and month of June 2024 selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880f757e14d8d7a2cbd0863/file-XTG7zeTGQ7.jpg) The report title, description, and logo can be changed/customized: - Rename your report by clicking on the existing name and then typing in the new title you’d like to use. Add a description to your report by clicking *Add Report description*. Upload a logo to your report, by clicking *Upload logo* on the right hand side. PNG and JPG files are supported. ![Buffer Analyze with arrows pointing to the report title, date, and option to upload logo](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880f6edc11e7d145471923a/file-iBBNcTNvFs.jpg) Each element of the report can be reordered using the up and down arrows, which are shown when hovering over a table or chart. If you’d like to remove a table or chart, hover over it and then click the x icon. You can also add notes to each individual chart by clicking ***Add chart note***. ![Image of Buffer Analyze custom report with an arrow pointing to Add chart note](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880fc3cb28ecf16639c8ca3/file-tESbP4V8dT.jpg) ## Downloading reports You can export the report by clicking *Export as PDF* at the top right.
