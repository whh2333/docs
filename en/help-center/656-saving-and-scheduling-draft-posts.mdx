        <p>It's important to capture your creative thoughts (even those partially-developed ones) right when you have them. With Buffer's draft features, you'll be able to save your drafts with or without a pre-scheduled date and time selected. Pretty slick, right?</p>

<h2 id="h_01FZ8PAWX11JAXHS0RXCR09Z7E">Accessing your draft posts</h2>
<p>You can find the draft posts for each of your social channels by clicking the social channel's name on the left side of your dashboard and then clicking <em><strong>Drafts</strong></em>. Note: if you are using the Calendar view, you will need to click the <i><b>List </b></i>view first:</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/673fb397268fb643f63a5e20/file-mSgr8HsN7M.jpg" alt="Buffer Drafts queue with the List view selected" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<p>You will also be able to access all of your pre-scheduled drafts from the calendar so that you have a view of your whole social content plan in one place. Note that if you didn't add a time and date to your draft, it would not appear in your calendar. We'll talk more about pre-scheduled drafts below.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b651468919a15d1b1d2a41/file-QbeEOJATtR.jpg" alt="Buffer Calendar showing drafts and posts" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<h2 id="h_01G3V0JF72D5RCVBH04T1VXAZA">Creating drafts from the drafts area</h2>
<p>You can create drafts right from the drafts area by typing in the "Create a new draft" composer field. From there, you can save your draft with no date/time specified, or you can pre-schedule the draft by clicking <em><strong>Set Time</strong></em><em>. </em>Pre-scheduling your draft will not cause it to automatically publish at the date and time you selected unless that draft post is moved to the queue prior to the pre-scheduled date/time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When a draft is scheduled and the scheduled time has passed, click <em><strong>Edit</strong></em> on the post and select a new time. Once that's saved, you'll see the <em><strong>Schedule Post</strong></em> option again.</p>
<p>Let's explore other ways to create draft posts.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="h_01FZ8PB406FF93GQM954S2AX19">Creating drafts from the queue</h2>
<p>To start your draft from your queue, click on the blue <em><strong>+ New</strong></em> button at the top of your dashboard, then click <i><b>Post</b></i> to open the composer. Craft your post.</p>
<p>When finished, if you'd like to store it in the drafts area of your account without specifying a date and time for publishing, click <em><strong>Save as Draft</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65252067e9c553dc8258e/file-NBgel16XEX.jpg" alt="Save as Draft" style="width: 455.977px; "></p>
<p>Alternatively, if you know the date and time you'd like your draft to eventually publish, you can pre-schedule your post by clicking on the down arrow and choosing <em><strong>Schedule Draft</strong></em>. As a reminder, this will not cause your draft to automatically publish at the date and time you selected unless that draft post is moved to the queue prior to the pre-scheduled date/time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6529e65e01777a9333645/file-eGtLPVKLCw.jpg" alt="Schedule Draft option in the Buffer composer" style="width: 535.977px; "></p>
<p>Speaking of which, the last action that you'll need to take before the draft is fully scheduled is to have someone with <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC" target="_self">full posting access</a> (this could be you or another member of your Buffer organization) click <em><strong>Add to Queue</strong></em> from within your drafts tab.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65384067e9c553dc8258f/file-KSHOib426v.jpg" alt="Buffer Add to Queue button in Drafts" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<h2 id="h_01FZ8PBC3R2ZRB1SV0PPMVJ92V">Creating drafts from the calendar</h2>
<p>If you love the full-context view of the calendar, there's good news: you can schedule and view drafts straight from your calendar view! Let's get into it.</p>
<ol>
 <li>First, you'll click <em><strong>Calendar</strong></em> in the upper left-hand menu from your publishing dashboard.</li>
 <li>From there, click on the date and time you‚Äôd like to schedule your draft. A composer will pop up and you can start drafting your post.</li>
 <li>When finished composing your draft post, click on the <em><strong>Schedule Draft</strong></em> button, and you‚Äôll immediately see your draft populate on your calendar at the date and time you originally selected.</li>
</ol>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù Scheduling your draft will not cause it to automatically publish at the date and time you selected. Instead, it will preset the date and time for publishing, but will still require a user with full posting access to click <i><b>Schedule Post</b></i> from the drafts tab before the post is considered ready to publish. If no date or time is selected for the draft, the draft will show <i><b>Add to Queue </b></i>instead.

<p>The below screenshot shows what it will look like when scheduling your draft from the calendar. Note that there isn't an option to save your post in this case, because you've already pre-selected a date and time in the calendar.&nbsp;</p><br>

<h2 id="h_01FZ8NP446ZA0F1V76Z2WGWGT6">Scheduling drafts to multiple social channels at once</h2>
<p>Looking at the screenshot above, you can see several social channels selected. When the draft is scheduled (or "saved" if composing your draft from the queue), the draft for each of your social channels will land in their respective drafts tabs.</p>
<p>We share instructions on how to find the draft posts for each of your social channels <a href="#h_01FZ8PAWX11JAXHS0RXCR09Z7E" target="_self">at the top of this article</a>.</p>
<h2 id="h_01H9TPN1C41P4CEEQ8QXNMDF3J">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Will a draft for one post going to multiple channels be saved as one draft?</h3>
<p>No, drafts sent to multiple social channels will be saved as independent drafts within each of those social channels' drafts areas. We share more about this <a href="#h_01FZ8NP446ZA0F1V76Z2WGWGT6" target="_self">below</a>.</p>
