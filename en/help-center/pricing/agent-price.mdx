## Credits Usage Policy

Credits are primarily consumed by two types of costs:

1. **LLM Tokens** — used for task planning, decision-making, and generating outputs.
2. **Third-party APIs** — used to access integrated external services such as image models, video models, video editing/processing, and related capabilities.

**The exact credit cost of a task depends on its complexity, duration, and the number of external calls involved.**
Credits are charged **only while the task is being processed**. Once a task is completed, **storing, hosting, displaying, or deploying its outputs does not consume any additional credits**, so there’s usually no need to delete completed tasks.

If a task fails due to an **AiToEarn technical issue**, we will **fully refund the credits consumed** for that task. We continuously optimize system efficiency to reduce the average credit cost per task over time.

For transparency, we list the **official pricing of all external services** below as a reference.
**In AiToEarn: 100 credits = USD $1.**
