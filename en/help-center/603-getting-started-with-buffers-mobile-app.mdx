Therefore, you'll want to make sure your timezone is correct and that you've set a posting schedule within your channel settings. Your posting schedule includes the days and times that you want Buffer to post for you whenever you use the ***Add to Queue ***option.</p> ### To adjust your timezone: - Select a channel from the channel menu in top left corner of the app. - Tap ***Settings ***(gear icon) in the lower right of the app.</li> - Tap <strong>*Timezone*</strong> under "Scheduling."</li> - Buffer should automatically find your timezone, based on your phone's settings, so you can tap the blue button that appears on your screen if that timezone is correct. Alternatively, you can tap the search bar at the top of the app to search for a city in your timezone to select it. üìù Each channel has its own timezone settings, so you'll want to make sure to adjust the timezone settings every time you connect a new channel to Buffer. ### Why should I create a posting schedule? <p>The quickest way to get your post added to your queue is to tap the <strong>*Add to Queue *</strong>option at the bottom-right of the composer. When doing this, your post will be added to the next available time slot taken from your posting schedule.</p> ### To adjust your posting schedule - Select a channel from the channel menu in top left corner of the app. - Tap ***Settings ***(gear icon) in the lower right of the app.</li> - Tap ***Posting Schedule ***under "Scheduling."</li> - Tap on a day of the week to adjust the posting times for that day. - From there, you can: <li></li>**Add a new posting time**: tap the blue Add a posting time link at the bottom of the screen, then select the time you want to add and tap Use this time.</li> <li></li>**Remove a posting time**: tap the one you want to remove and tap Remove.</li> <li></li>**Disable a posting day: **tap the toggle at the top of the screen to turn OFF posting for that day. It will be blue (enabled) by default).</li> - Once you're happy with the changes you've made, tap ***Save ***in the upper right corner of the screen to save your changes.</li> ## Creating and schedule a post With your channel(s) connected and your posting schedule and timezone set, you're ready to create your first post! Let's create a simple post with text and an image to get started. - Tap the blue + icon at the bottom middle of your screen to open the composer. On **Android**, tap the ***blue pencil icon*** at the bottom right of your screen to open the composer.</li> - The social channel you just connected will already be selected. - Type or paste the caption of your post. - Tap ***Add Attachment*** to add an image to your post.</li> - You'll have various options for adding media attachments. On **iOS**, you can tap the ***camera icon*** to add an image from your phone.
