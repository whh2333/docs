# Troubleshooting "Whoops! Buffer's servers couldn't be reached" error Are you having trouble with images or videos getting stuck in a "Finishing up" state? Or are you coming across this server error: > Whoops, Buffer's servers couldn't be reached to save the update, sorry about that. Would you be up for trying again? There are a few different reasons why this may be happening and this article will walk through the steps to troubleshoot the most common causes behind this error. In this article: - [Ad blockers and pop-up blockers](#h_01H9NTMQ5AHTJYVY58ASD12C59) - [Browser settings](#h_01H9NTNBCV5AFWGZDT20BPZH49) ## Ad blockers and pop-up blockers You will most commonly see these issues if you have an ad blocker or pop-up blocker running in your browser. To test if this is causing the issue, [open Buffer in an incognito window](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/508-opening-buffer-in-an-incognito-or-private-window-how-to-safelist-buffer-and-using-a-vpn#h_01GGABZBW3EQ247KTM4YY1D2VC), and then try scheduling the post again. If the issue doesn't occur, it's very likely that the ad blocker or pop-up blocker installed in your browser is causing a conflict. Here are some of the most common ones: - Disconnect.me - uBlock Origin - AdBlock Plus - Ghostery - Privacy Badger If there is an ad blocker conflict, we would recommend adding Buffer to your allowed sites for those add-ons and trying again. ## Browser settings ### Firefox *If you are using a Firefox browser, sometimes the default settings can cause some trouble. To change these settings, please follow these steps:* - In Firefox, navigate to the browser menu and choose ***Options***. - Select ***Privacy & Security***. - Within the Enhanced Tracking Protection section, click the ***Manage Exceptions... ***button - Add the exception "www.buffer.com". ### Chrome *If you're using the Chrome browser, you may have "Enhanced Safe Browsing" enabled, which could cause conflicts with Buffer (in particular, the Buffer browser extension). To change this setting, please follow these steps: * - Go to your [Google Account](https://myaccount.google.com/). - On the left, select Security. - Scroll to ‚ÄúEnhanced Safe Browsing for your Account.‚Äù - Select Manage Enhanced Safe Browsing. - Turn Enhanced Safe Browsing on or off. If you turn on Enhanced Safe Browsing for your account, Enhanced Safe Browsing in Chrome will also be turned on when: - You‚Äôre signed in to Chrome - Sync is turned on in Chrome without a custom passphrase If you turn off Enhanced Safe Browsing in your account: - It may take up to 24 hours for this setting change to complete. - Google Safe Browsing continues to help protect you from dangerous websites, downloads, and extensions Further information from Chrome can be found [here](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/11577602?hl=en). üìùStill need help?
