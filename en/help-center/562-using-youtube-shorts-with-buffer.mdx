<h2 id="How-YouTube-Shorts-works-with-Buffer-HT1eQ">How YouTube Shorts works with Buffer</h2>
<p>When it comes to YouTube, there are two types of publishing:</p>
<p><i><b>Automatic publishing </b></i>- schedule your Short in Buffer and we'll automatically publish it for you.</p>
<p><i><b>Notification publishing </b></i>- schedule your Short in Buffer and you'll get a notification on your phone when it's time to publish your Short and you can finish publishing in the YouTube app.</p>
<div>
 You'll see these options in the composer where you can either choose&nbsp;<b>Automatic&nbsp;</b>(if your post can be scheduled automatically) or&nbsp;<b>Notify Me&nbsp;</b>(if you either choose to get a mobile notification for your post or if it contains content that can't be published automatically, such as videos that are over the duration limit).&nbsp;
</div>

<p>Head to your Channels area to connect your YouTube channel:&nbsp;<a href="https://account.buffer.com/channels">https://account.buffer.com/channels</a></p>
<p>You can connect multiple YouTube channels to Buffer. To make sure Buffer knows which one want to connect, log in to the Google account that is the owner of the YouTube channel in another browser tab before trying to connect it to Buffer.</p>

<p>We can post all day, but the real excitement comes when seeing the reactions to our posts.</p>

<h2 id="FAQ-GpbUg">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Is it possible to change the default category for YouTube Shorts?</h3>
<p>Currently, Buffer does not support changing the default category for YouTube Shorts when posting. YouTube automatically assigns the category to Shorts, and this setting cannot be customized through Buffer.</p>
<p>If you want to change the category for a Short after it‚Äôs published, you‚Äôll need to update it directly in YouTube Studio.</p>
