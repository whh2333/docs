# Getting started as a user in an organization <a href="javascript:window.print()" class="printArticle" title="Print this article" aria-label="Print this Article"><i class="icon-print"></i></a> If you are part of a team and you‚Äôve been invited to Buffer as a user within an organization, this guide can help you get set up and ready to work with the tools and social channels you have been given permission to access.

You might also be part of another organization as a user with access to that organization's social channels. [Learn more about the levels of user permissions](#h_01F65J9ENYN98ADQZWD8MVHZ2F) below.</p> <div class="callout-blue"> #### Notes - You will always access an organization‚Äôs social channels and tools on your own Buffer dashboard and you will never need to log into another Buffer account. - You will have access to all of the business features of that organization even if you personally have a different plan. Most users of an organization are personally on a free plan. However, when they switch over to the organization they've been invited to, they'll see access to the features available on their organization's business plan. - Missing access to some tools?

Reach out to our team at [hello@buffer.com](mailto:hello@buffer.com) so we can help!</p> </div> ## Access levels and permissions Your organization owner will set up your access to the organization and to social channels. Your access level and permissions are explained below. üìù It‚Äôs important to note that even with admin access, you won‚Äôt automatically have access to all channels; you still need to be invited to any channels you should see within each tool. If you have admin access but haven‚Äôt been invited to any channels, you won‚Äôt be able to create posts or respond to comments. However, as an admin, you are able to invite yourself to any channel at anytime. | **Tool** | **Admin access** | **Full posting access (channel specific)** | **Approval required access (channel specific)** | | | Account settings | - Connect and manage social channels - Invite and manage users - Manage subscription and billing (account owner only) | - Read-only access to channels area | - Read-only access to channels area | | | Publishing | - Dependent on the permissions level granted for that social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) | - Create posts - Approve draft posts from other team members | - Create draft posts | | | Engagement | - Dependent on the permissions level granted for that social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) | - Respond to all Instagram and Facebook comments | - None - Team members must have Full Posting access to use the engagement tool | | | Analytics | - Viewing metrics - Create custom reports - View campaigns | - View metrics | - View metrics | | ## Working within your dashboard ### Switching your organization Once you‚Äôve accepted your invitation and you‚Äôve set up your account (if you didn‚Äôt have one already), you can now see your own individual organization and the new organization by navigating to your account menu. You can switch between the two organizations depending on where you‚Äôd like to work. ![Buffer organization list in the profile icon menu](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67ed76636d642372f70e342d/file-cW3rRh0D8p.jpg) If you are a member of three or more organizations, you'll see the active organization listed and then you can over over it to see the full list of organizations you belong to. Select an organization from the list to switch. ![Buffer profile icon menu with 3 organizations](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67ed791697f8701aacdbb2e5/file-SI1YiTBkF2.jpg) <div class="callout-blue"> #### üìù Notes - If both organizations have the same name (such as the default ‚ÄúMy Organization‚Äù), you can hover over each organization to see which channels are connected. The owner can [rename the organization using this guide](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/669-renaming-your-buffer-organization).</li> - If your organization owner hasn‚Äôt set you up with access to any channels yet, you‚Äôll see a message saying they need to grant you access. We suggest contacting the owner and asking them to [set up your permissions using this guide](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization).</li> </div> #### Scheduling posts in the publishing dashboard <p>If this is the first time you‚Äôve used Buffer‚Äôs publishing tool, we recommend visiting our [guide for scheduling posts](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/642-scheduling-posts). If you‚Äôve scheduled posts before, keep in mind that you will have access to many other features with the organization‚Äôs business plan that you may not have used previously if you were on other plans.</p> #### Working with drafts <p>All users with channel permissions are able to create draft posts in the drafts area. The drafts area is great for crafting ideas for posts, as well as creating final posts that you'd like to submit for approval. The option to request approval on drafts, as well as the ability to approve draft posts, will depend on permissions. [Learn more on how to create and approve draft posts here](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts).</p> #### Viewing metrics and working with reports in the analytics dashboard <p>All users can view metrics in the dashboards. All admins can view metrics in channels they have permission to access, plus create reports and view campaigns. If this is the first time you‚Äôve used Buffer‚Äôs analytics tool, we recommend visiting our guide to [Getting started with Buffer's analytics features](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/602-getting-started-with-buffers-analytics-features).</p> #### Engaging with Instagram and Facebook comments <p>Team members with **Full Posting access** for an Instagram business account or Facebook Page within your Buffer organization can respond to the comments that come into that social channel.</p> <p>If you or another user in your Buffer organization has **Approval Required access** for an Instagram business account or a Facebook Page within your Buffer organization, they will not be able to access or respond to the comments that come through to that account.</p> #### Connecting or refreshing channels <p>If you have admin access via the social network itself, you can connect and refresh (reconnect) channels within the organization. It‚Äôs very important to be sure you‚Äôre connecting channels in the right organization. You can [switch organizations](#h_01F65J9MQRY276VPK78N4ETXMR) in the account menu as shown above. [Follow this guide to learn more about connecting and refreshing channels](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/572-connecting-or-refreshing-channels-as-a-user-of-an-organization).</p> üìù As an Admin, once you connect a social channel, you will have Full Posting Access to it. <p>If you notice that some of the channels you have access to have been locked, this is likely because the owner of the organization [downgraded their account](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/597-what-happens-when-you-downgrade-to-the-free-plan). When a plan is downgraded, the account is moved to the Free plan with access to only three social channels and no additional users. This is the reason those channels become locked for you.</p> In this case, you should chat with the organization owner and see if they had intentionally downgraded the account. It‚Äôs possible they didn‚Äôt know that downgrading their account would stop you from being able to access those channels or tools. ## Removing yourself from an organization <p>If you need to be removed from an organization, you can reach out to the organization owner or one of the organization Admins and ask them to [remove you from the organization using these steps](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization#Removing-users-Ru7Yr).</p> ## Other articles that might be helpful: <li></li>[Adding users and setting up permissions](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization)</li> <li></li>[Changing your Buffer account name and avatar picture](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/673-changing-your-buffer-account-name-and-avatar)</li> <li></li>[Switching organizations on the web](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/873-switching-organizations-on-the-web)</li>
