The drafts area is great for crafting ideas for posts, as well as creating final posts that you'd like to submit for approval. The option to request approval on drafts, as well as the ability to approve draft posts, will depend on permissions.&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts" target="_blank">Learn more on how to create and approve draft posts here</a>.</p> <h4 id="01F65JGXB23XD5E1YP9RA5EQDQ">Viewing metrics and working with reports in the analytics dashboard</h4> <p>All users can view metrics in the dashboards.

It‚Äôs very important to be sure you‚Äôre connecting channels in the right organization. You can <a href="#h_01F65J9MQRY276VPK78N4ETXMR">switch organizations</a> in the account menu as shown above.&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/572-connecting-or-refreshing-channels-as-a-user-of-an-organization" target="_self">Follow this guide to learn more about connecting and refreshing channels</a>.</p> <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìù As an Admin, once you connect a social channel, you will have Full Posting Access to it.&nbsp;</p> </div> <p>If you notice that some of the channels you have access to have been locked, this is likely because the owner of the organization&nbsp;<a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/597-what-happens-when-you-downgrade-to-the-free-plan" target="_self">downgraded their account</a>. When a plan is downgraded, the account is moved to the Free plan with access to only three social channels and no additional users. This is the reason those channels become locked for you.</p> <p>In this case, you should chat with the organization owner and see if they had intentionally downgraded the account. It‚Äôs possible they didn‚Äôt know that downgrading their account would stop you from being able to access those channels or tools.</p> <h2 id="Removing-yourself-from-an-organization-VVzp9">Removing yourself from an organization</h2> <p>If you need to be removed from an organization, you can reach out to the organization owner or one of the organization Admins and ask them to <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization#Removing-users-Ru7Yr">remove you from the organization using these steps</a>.</p> <h2>Other articles that might be helpful:</h2> <ul> <li></li><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization">Adding users and setting up permissions</a></li> <li></li><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/673-changing-your-buffer-account-name-and-avatar">Changing your Buffer account name and avatar picture</a></li> <li></li><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/873-switching-organizations-on-the-web">Switching organizations on the web</a></li> </ul> </article>
