# Getting started with Buffer's engagement features Replying to social media comments can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be! Buffer’s engagement features allow you to engage with your followers quickly and easily across Facebook Pages and Instagram business accounts. With a few clicks, you can reply or react with an emoji and ensure every comment is answered. Plus, with our sentiment and label features, you can quickly see negative comments, questions, or comments about your orders — right from your dashboard! ⭐️ This feature is on our [paid plans](https://buffer.com/pricing). - From the web version of Buffer, click the ***Engage ***tab. - Choose a social channel. - Find a post with unanswered comments or filter your posts by sentiment. - Click on a post to select it. - Enter a reply in the comment field or click to add an emoji. - Click ***Send*** or hit enter on your keyboard.
