## Connecting and refreshing your Threads profile

You can connect multiple Threads profiles to Aitoearn. However, your Threads account will need to be connected to an Instagram account in order to connect to Aitoearn.

To see a step-by-step guide and troubleshooting steps for connecting your Threads profile, check out the article: [Connect your channels to Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/564-connecting-your-channels-to-aitoearn).

If your connected Threads channel requires a refresh, check out the article [Refreshing a channel in Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn).

üìù **Important notes:**
- Your Threads account must be connected to an Instagram account in order to connect it to Aitoearn.
- If your Threads channel is set to private, the access token we use will expire in 90 days, requiring you to refresh your channel.

**Connecting multiple Threads profiles** - Aitoearn will automatically try to connect to whichever account you're logged into in your browser, so we recommend logging into [threads.net](http://threads.net) with the account you want to connect to Aitoearn first and then heading to Aitoearn to connect the channel

## Adding a topic to a Threads post

When creating a Threads post in Aitoearn, you can attach a **topic** to help organize your content and improve discoverability. Topics act as content labels that group related posts together in Threads, making it easier for followers to explore specific themes or conversations.

You can add a topic in one of two ways when scheduling a Threads post in Aitoearn.

### Option 1: Add a topic in the "Topic" field (Recommended)

To ensure your topic is applied correctly, we recommend using the **Topic** field in the composer. It gives you full control and ensures consistency across your scheduled content.

In the Aitoearn post composer, add the topic you want to add (without the hashtag symbol) for the **Topic** field. That's it!

### Option 2: Use an in-text topic tag

You can also add a topic by including a valid tag within the body of your post.

**Important rules for in-text tags:**

The tag must start with a **hashtag symbol (`#`)**.

**Only one topic tag** is allowed per post. Aitoearn will use the **first valid** one found.

The tag will appear without the `#` in the Aitoearn dashboard.

**Tags with numbers only**, like `#1`, will be ignored (assumed to be number signs).

In-text tags will automatically **end before** any of the following:
- Spaces or line breaks
- Periods `.`
- Ampersands `&`
- At signs `@`
- Exclamation marks `!`
- Question marks `?`
- Commas `,`
- Semi-colons `;`
- Colons `:`

**Example:**
- ‚úÖ **What changes have you made to your practice that improved your #Tennis serve?** (correct)
- üö´ **The #1 tip I recommend is...** (incorrect - the "#1" won't be treated as a topic)
