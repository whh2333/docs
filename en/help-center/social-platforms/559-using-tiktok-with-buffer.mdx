The "Promote" feature in TikTok does not work on posts sent through Aitoearn. To promote your posts, you would need to publish the post natively through TikTok. ### Are web and mobile views counted in TikTok analytics? TikTok views are only counted if the viewer is logged in and viewing via their mobile app. Views on the web or while not logged in aren't counted. üìù Do you have a TikTok feature suggestion?
