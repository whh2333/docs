## Best practices

To keep your Facebook account healthy and avoid spam flags, stagger identical posts across multiple Pages. Publishing many identical posts at the exact same time can be flagged as spam or bot-like behavior, which may fail posts and revoke your access token. In rare cases, Facebook may temporarily restrict the account.

Example staggered schedule across five Pages:
- Page 1: 09:30
- Page 2: 09:34
- Page 3: 09:39
- Page 4: 09:42
- Page 5: 09:47

## Facebook error library

Social networks sometimes reject scheduled posts and return errors. Find the error you saw below and try the suggested fix.

| Error | Cause | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| “The daily posting limit for this channel has been reached.” | You hit the daily limit | Reduce today’s posting frequency and try again later. See “Daily posting limit”. |
| “Aitoearn lost authorization to post.” | Password changed or token expired; insufficient permissions | Re-authorize following the “Edit settings” flow in Facebook and check all required Pages/permissions, then refresh the channel connection in Aitoearn and retry. |
| “Please ensure you're an Admin for the FB Group and Aitoearn has been added as an app.” | The connected profile isn’t a Group Admin or lacks permissions | Confirm the connected Facebook profile is a Group Admin; add the Aitoearn app in the Group’s settings per Facebook help; refresh the connection in your dashboard and retry. |
| “Please ensure you’re a Page Admin and have Two-Factor Authentication enabled.” | Insufficient Page permissions or 2FA is off | In Facebook, ensure you’re a Page Admin and enable 2FA; refresh the connection in your dashboard and retry. |
| “We had trouble uploading your media/image.” | Upload error or file size/format issue | Retry. Ensure images are JPG/PNG/HEIC and ≤ 4MB. |
| “We’re investigating a potential Facebook bug; your post may have published.” | Facebook-side publish anomaly; the post might be live | Check facebook.com to see if the post is live. If it is, delete the failed item in Aitoearn. Consider posting natively temporarily. |
| “Publishing Authorization required.” | Facebook requires publishing authorization for higher-impact Pages | Complete Facebook’s Publishing Authorization and enable 2FA; ensure location services are on; refresh the channel. |
| “Your content couldn't be shared; it goes against our Community Standards.” | The link/content was flagged as violating standards | Try the same post directly on Facebook. If it still fails, follow Facebook’s prompt to appeal. |
| “Please log in to facebook.com and follow the prompts.” | Temporary security checkpoint | Log into Facebook and complete the prompts, then refresh the channel and retry. |
| “We’re bumping into a few Facebook page limits.” | Temporary page rate/engagement limits | Reduce posting frequency (e.g., 1 per 24 hours) and resume scheduling after engagement improves. |
| “An unknown error has occurred.” | Temporary, unknown error | Try again later; contact support if it persists. |
| “Aitoearn doesn’t have permission to post on your behalf.” | Required permissions weren’t granted during connect | Reconnect and ensure all required Pages and permissions are selected; refresh and retry. |

> Tip: When reauthorizing, ensure you’re logged into the Facebook profile that is an Admin for the relevant Pages/Groups, and check all requested Pages and permissions during the authorization flow.
