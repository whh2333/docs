Currently, Aitoearn does not support changing the default category for YouTube Shorts when posting. YouTube automatically assigns the category to Shorts, and this setting cannot be customized through Aitoearn. If you want to change the category for a Short after it’s published, you’ll need to update it directly in YouTube Studio. 📝Do you have a YouTube feature suggestion?
