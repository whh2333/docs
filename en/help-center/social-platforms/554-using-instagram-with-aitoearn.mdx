## How Instagram works with Aitoearn

Instagram behaves a bit differently. To auto‑publish, you need:
- A [Business or Creator account](#switch-to-professional)
- Media that meets Instagram specs and one of the following types:
  - Single image or carousel (multiple images)
  - Single video post
  - Reels (portrait, ≤ 90 seconds)
  - Stories (portrait images or ≤ 15‑second videos)

> Note: Due to API limits, Creator accounts cannot auto‑publish Stories.

## Connect and refresh your Instagram accounts
1. Log into the target Instagram account in your browser first.
2. Back in Aitoearn, connect the Instagram account under Spaces.
3. You can connect multiple Instagram accounts and refresh them when needed.

## Find your Instagram account type
On your phone:
1. Open Instagram and go to your profile.
2. Tap the menu (three lines) in the top‑right.
3. At the bottom, look for one of the following:
   - “Business tools and controls” → Business account
   - “Account type and tools” → Personal account
   - “Creator tools and controls” → Creator account

## Switch your Instagram account to a Professional account
1. In Instagram, open the menu.
2. Scroll to “For professionals” and open “Account type and tools”.
3. Tap “Switch to professional account”. If you see “Business tools and controls”, you’re already on a professional account—return to Aitoearn to reconnect or refresh.
4. Follow the prompts to choose a category.
5. Choose “Creator” or “Business”.

## Plan and publish (Posts / Reels / Stories)
- Supported on both Web and mobile apps.
- Mentions in captions: type the exact username with @ (search isn’t supported while typing). It will become a clickable link after publishing.
- Tag people in images: only for auto‑published image posts. Reels/Stories or “Notify Me” posts are not supported.
- Up to 20 @ mentions per post.
- Shop Grid: add external links to each post and aggregate them on a clickable grid linked from your bio (not available for personal accounts).

### Frequency & limits
- Up to 50 items every 24 hours (posts, Stories and Reels combined).
- Caption limit: 2,200 characters; first comment: 2,196 characters.
- Alt text: currently images only (single or carousel). Not available for video, Reels or Stories.
- Re‑share: Instagram doesn’t support scheduled re‑shares.
- Location: available for posts and Reels (not Stories).
- Hashtags: add them in the editor; they become hyperlinks after publishing.

### Common limitations
- No popular music tracks for posts or Reels via API.
- Creator accounts cannot auto‑publish Stories.
- Link previews when sharing to other networks are not guaranteed.
- When scheduling multiple assets to Stories, upload each as a separate Story.
