For more information, visit our [full guide to adding tags (mentions) here](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/587-adding-mentions-tags-in-posts). | | **Hashtags/"Topics"** | - Threads supports use of only one hashtag per post, referred to as "Topics." - You will be able to create hashtags with the # symbol and then once posted, the first word of a hashtag is converted into a topic. All subsequent hashtags appear as plain text. - If your hashtag has multiple words, remove any spacing from the hashtag. (e.g. '#BufferScheduling' instead of '#Buffer Scheduling') - Hashtags/Topics can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, but cannot contain just numbers.

See below for more information on adding topics to your Threads posts. | | ## Adding a topic to a Threads post When creating a Threads post in Buffer, you can attach a **topic** to help organize your content and improve discoverability. Topics act as content labels that group related posts together in Threads, making it easier for followers to explore specific themes or conversations. You can add a topic in one of two ways when scheduling a Threads post in Buffer. ### Option 1: Add a topic in the "Topic" field (Recommended) To ensure your topic is applied correctly, we recommend using the **Topic** field in the composer. It gives you full control and ensures consistency across your scheduled content. In the Buffer post composer, add the topic you want to add (without the hashtag symbol) for the **Topic** field. That's it! ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6881023b401e5f22412d7066/file-lSAzM70nHy.jpg) ### Option 2: Use an in-text topic tag You can also add a topic by including a valid tag within the body of your post. ![Image of Buffer composer with an inline topic (#TennisThreads) added to the post. Arrows pointing to the hashtag in the post and in the post preview.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/688101e8c11e7d1454719293/file-iulU0BKSxh.jpg) **Important rules for in-text tags:** The tag must start with a **hashtag symbol (**`**#**` ** )**.**Only one topic tag** is allowed per post. Buffer will use the **first valid** one found.The tag will appear without the `#` in the Buffer dashboard.**Tags with numbers only**, like `#1` , will be ignored (assumed to be number signs).In-text tags will automatically **end before** any of the following: - Spaces or line breaks Periods `.` Ampersands `&` At signs `@` Exclamation marks `!` Question marks `?` Commas `,` Semi-colons `;` Colons `:` **Example:** - ‚úÖ **What changes have you made to your practice that improved your #Tennis serve? **(correct) - üö´ **The #1 tip I recommend is... ** (incorrect - the "#1" won‚Äôt be treated as a topic) ## Image and video specifications for Threads Threads supports images and videos.
