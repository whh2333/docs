We are unable to autocomplete or verify usernames at this time. | | **Hashtags** | You can use a #hashtag to make your post discoverable by anyone searching for that hashtag. Hashtags can contain alphanumeric characters and underscores, but cannot contain numbers only. Learn more about [how hashtags work in Buffer here](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/586-how-hashtags-work-in-buffer). | | | **Character limit** | 500 characters per post. Learn more about [Character limits for each social network here](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/588-character-limits-for-each-social-network). üìùAlthough some Mastodon servers have been customized to support a higher number of characters, Buffer can't detect if the server you're posting to has a higher limit than the default, so we use the default. | | **Emoji** | Although Mastodon supports custom emojis, we only support emoji from our emoji picker at this time. | | | **Links** | If you include links in your post, they must begin with http:// or https://, otherwise they'll be shown as plain text. All links are counted as 23 characters, no matter how long they actually are, so there is no need to use a link shortener to save characters. In fact, [using a link shortener is actively discouraged](https://mstdn.social/@feditips/107769116816478390#:~:text=You%20don't%20need%20to%20use%20link%20shorteners%20on%20Mastodon,better%20for%20privacy%20than%20Twitter). | | **Daily posting limit** | 100 posts per 24 hours.
