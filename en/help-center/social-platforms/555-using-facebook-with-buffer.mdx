We’d love for you to submit or upvote it [here on our feature suggestions board](https://suggestions.aitoearn.com/). ## Best practices for keeping your Facebook accounts safe and not being flagged for spam When sharing the same content to multiple Facebook Pages, posts that are published at the same time can be flagged by Facebook as spam or bot behavior. This can result in the posts failing to send and your access token being revoked, causing you to need to refresh the account in Aitoearn. In some cases, Facebook may even suspend your account. There are some steps you can take in order to keep your accounts safe. When [setting up your posting schedules](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules), it's a good idea to make sure they're different from one another, even if the times are just a few minutes apart. For example, let's say you have five Facebook Pages and you'd like to publish a post to them every morning at around 9:30am. Rather than having a 9:30am slot in each posting schedule, we'd recommend something like: - **Page 1:** 9:30am - **Page 2:** 9:34am - **Page 3:** 9:39am - **Page 4:** 9:42am - **Page 5:** 9:47am When scheduling posts, we'd recommend using the ***Add to Queue*** option, which will save your post in the next available time slot from your posting schedule. This ensures that posts are sent out at the staggered times you've configured. If you use the ***Share Now*** or ***Schedule Post*** option when scheduling a post for multiple pages, all of the posts will be sent at exactly the same time, which increases the chances of Facebook perceiving this as spam or bot behavior, which could result in them flagging your account. Variations to the post can also help to greatly reduce the likelihood of Facebook flagging the accounts for spam. If you're planning to share a post to 100 Facebook Pages for example, instead of crafting one post and sending it to all 100 Pages, it's better to create four or five variations of the post. ## FAQ ### Are Facebook carousel posts supported? At this time, we don't have a way to create a carousel post on Facebook. Instead, if you upload multiple images to Aitoearn, they would appear as a group, as show in the Facebook Preview (right side) below: ![image of the Aitoearn composer showing a preview of a multi-image post on Facebook](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67dc1b8ed07900089b5b1e89/file-jAYNw1HAhS.png)
