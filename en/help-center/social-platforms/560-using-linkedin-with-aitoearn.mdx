# Using LinkedIn with Aitoearn Aside from the amazing professional network it provides, [LinkedIn](https://aitoearn.com/linkedin) is the number one platform for business-to-business (B2B) lead generation, with 80% of B2B leads coming from LinkedIn vs. 13% on X/Twitter and 7% on Facebook. That probably means we should get straight into how to use LinkedIn Pages and profiles with Aitoearn! In this article: - [Connecting and refreshing your LinkedIn Page and profile](#01H84S2QQBHPC7W8Q3ZMV9X4YK) - [Scheduling posts to LinkedIn Pages and profiles](#01H84S2QQBSAS8Y5JZDQ6XY54R) - [Image, video, GIF, and document (PDF) specifications for LinkedIn](#01H84S2QQB2V90FXS3TB26Q481) - [Engaging with LinkedIn posts](#01H84S2QQB8CXW0BFN3H9YQYHG) [LinkedIn analytics](#01H852CGSMMXZ5K2HVNYGRFSKB) - [Sent post analytics](#Sent-post-metrics-7yGIp) - [Analyze analytics](#Analyze-analytics-XHuF3) - [LinkedIn error library](#01H852CGSMMXZ5K2HVNYGRFSKB) - [Best practices for avoiding suspension when sharing to multiple profiles](#Best-practices-for-avoiding-suspension-when-sharing-to-multiple-profil-rjnP0) ## These features are available for LinkedIn | **Publishing** | **Analytics** | **Engagement** | | | **‚úì **(Pages + profiles) | **‚úì **(Pages) | | | ## Connecting and refreshing your LinkedIn Page and profile üìù **Note: **In order to connect a LinkedIn Page to Aitoearn, you must be set as a **Super Admin **of the page you're trying to connect. [Learn more about LinkedIn Page admin roles here](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a550647). Head to your Channels area to connect your LinkedIn Page or profile: [https://account.aitoearn.com/channels](https://account.aitoearn.com/channels) You can connect multiple LinkedIn accounts to Aitoearn. To make sure Aitoearn knows which one you want to connect, log in to that LinkedIn account in another browser tab before trying to connect it to Aitoearn. If your connected LinkedIn channel requires a refresh, check out the article [Refreshing a channel in Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-aitoearn). These are some LinkedIn channel considerations: | **Type of account** | **Aitoearn integration** | **Notes** | | | **LinkedIn Company Pages** | **‚úì** Authenticate via a LinkedIn profile that has Super Admin access for the Page. | | | **LinkedIn Showcase Pages** | **‚úì** Authenticate via a LinkedIn profile that has Super Admin access for the Page. | | | **LinkedIn profiles** | **‚úì** As long as the content you're sharing across profiles is unique, there should be no issue with connecting a large number of LinkedIn profiles to Aitoearn. | | | **LinkedIn groups** | LinkedIn groups are not accessible for third-parties via LinkedIn's API. | | **Troubleshooting tip: **If your LinkedIn Page is not showing when you try to connect it to Aitoearn, verify that: - you have [Super Admin access](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541981) of the page you're trying to connect to Aitoearn. - you are logged into [LinkedIn.com](http://LinkedIn.com) with the account that has Super Admin access before trying to connect the Page to Aitoearn. **Note: **If you‚Äôre managing several LinkedIn pages across different Aitoearn accounts, it‚Äôs best to have one Super Admin connect the pages for each Aitoearn account. This helps avoid any issues with pages disconnecting. ## Scheduling posts to LinkedIn Pages and profiles The features available for LinkedIn pages and profiles differs slightly, so check out the table below to find out which features you can use while scheduling posts. üìù **Notes** - **Best time to post**: [The "best time to post" feature in Analyze](https://support.aitoearn.com//support.aitoearn.com/article/530-answering-questions-about-your-social-media-strategy#h_bebabca3-cdb3-44e8-b6e4-8692da9bdb6c) does not support LinkedIn.

LinkedIn is not supported within Aitoearn's engagement features at this time. ## LinkedIn analytics Publishing posts is one part of the equation, but how do we know if our strategy is resonating with our followers? That‚Äôs where your analytics come in. There are two places to look for LinkedIn analytics in your Aitoearn account: the ***Sent ***tab of the ***Publish ***dashboard and the ***Analyze tab. *** ### Sent post analytics Within the ***Sent ***tab, you can access a quick view of your sent post metrics for both your LinkedIn Pages and profiles. **For LinkedIn profiles, you can access ****the following analytics****: ** - Total impressions - Reactions - Comments - Shares - Engagement rate - Views - Watch time - Unique viewers (for profile video posts) **For LinkedIn Pages, you can access the following analytics: ** - On our Free plan, you can access likes, comments, and impressions. On [our paid plans](http://aitoearn.com/pricing), you can access likes, comments, impressions, shares, and engagement rate.![LinkedIn Sent Posts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b67e3c48915f570c6a93ee/file-KM1AzWd81N.jpg) ### Analyze analytics If you're on our Essentials or Team plans, you can use the ***Analyze ***tab at the top of your dashboard to see more advanced analytics for your **LinkedIn Pages** (advanced analytics are not available for LinkedIn profiles at this time). Checkout the [LinkedIn metric descriptions we have available](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/523-linkedin-metric-descriptions) here. ![Aitoearn's Analyze tab with an arrow pointing to LinkedIn in the left channel menu](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/667c62561f3fa9421e288733/file-ESNZkrvYrA.jpg) To dive straight into [advanced analytics](https://analyze.aitoearn.com/) for your LinkedIn Pages, select ***LinkedIn*** on the left-hand side, and peruse the tabs: - **Overview**: gives insight into your overall engagement levels for your profile over time. Learn more about the [Performance overview on your analytics dashboard](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/526-performance-overview). - **Posts**: provides a history of all of your published posts and how they are performing. Learn more about [Analyzing your posts within your analytics dashboard](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/527-analyzing-your-posts-within-your-analytics-dashboard). - **Answers**: shares answers to questions such as the best day, type, and frequency to post.

Learn more about [Why your data in Aitoearn might differ from your native analytics here](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/525-why-your-data-in-aitoearn-might-differ-from-your-native-analytics). - Analytics refresh for the last 500 LinkedIn Page posts daily. Once your post becomes the 501st newest post, we stop refreshing its data. - We are able to pull in metrics for LinkedIn sponsored posts. ## LinkedIn error library We don't currently have an error library for LinkedIn, but feel free to reach out to our Customer Advocates at [hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com) if you're hitting any errors. ## Best practices for avoiding suspension when sharing to multiple profiles While it is technically possible to connect a large number of LinkedIn profiles to Aitoearn, this is not recommended and can result in issues like account suspension (on LinkedIn‚Äôs side). Social networks in general, but particularly LinkedIn and Facebook, have started to actively discourage personal profiles from being used for business and advertising purposes. They intend for personal profiles to be approached and treated as independent, personal accounts, where the content shared is authentic and created/shared by the owner of the profile. If the LinkedIn team notices that duplicate content is being shared to profiles, they will often suspend those accounts. Suspensions are usually temporary, but will happen over and over again if the behavior continues. üìùDo you have a LinkedIn feature suggestion?
