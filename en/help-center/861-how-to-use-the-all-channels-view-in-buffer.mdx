This means that you view a list of scheduled posts for all channels at once or you can approve all of your team members posts in one place (vs. having to view each queue individually). **Queue: **Use the Queue tab to see all upcoming posts that have been scheduled. **Drafts: **Use the Drafts tab to see your drafts across your social channels. **Approvals: **Use the Approvals tab to see all posts that need approval. **Sent: **Use the Sent tab to see all of your published posts. <div class="callout-blue"> <p>**Good to Knows:**</p> - Failed posts will also appear in the Queue tab. - Expired drafts will also appear in the Drafts tab. - Scheduled drafts will appear in both the Drafts tab and the Queue tab (drafts will be indicated by a banner at the top of each draft). - If a draft has been scheduled, the list in the Drafts tab will be organized with scheduled drafts appearing at the top of the list. </div> ## Filtering by channel If you prefer to narrow down the content by channel(s), you can use the ***Channels*** filter to select which channel(s) to view. For example, if you manage the LinkedIn and Facebook pages for multiple clients (Client A, Client B and Client C), you can select Client A's Facebook Page and Instagram account in the dropdown, so you‚Äôll only see content for those channels. ![All Channels view - filter by channel (LinkedIn and Facebook selected)](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6792a87e82f22a4614b8da0d/file-WQj4PSWHyi.jpg) ## Filtering by Tags [If you‚Äôve organized your content with Tags](https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/585-creating-and-managing-campaigns), you can choose to view your content by tag. To do this, click the ***Tags*** filter and select which tags you‚Äôd like to view and we‚Äôll display the tagged content for you. ![All Channels view - Filter by tags](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6792a9527be08c2ecfcf25e7/file-EgtDmcLCup.jpg)
