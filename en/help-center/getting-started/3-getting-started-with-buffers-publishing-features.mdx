The first step to getting started with Aitoearn is to connect your social channels. You can then configure a posting schedule, engage your audience, analyze results, and even **monetize** your content.

## Connect your first channel to Aitoearn

- To speed things up, log in to the social network first, then open Aitoearn in a separate tab.
- In Aitoearn, click **Add Channels**.

- Choose the channel you want to connect.
- Click **Start connecting** in the popup.
- Authorize Aitoearn to access the channel.
- Click **Add to Aitoearn**.
- A success toast will appear in the top‑right corner.

## Space settings

- Every connected channel belongs to a Space (e.g., desktop or mobile environment).
- In a Space you can configure device fingerprint info; the most important one is the IP address.
- You can create any number of Spaces in Aitoearn and switch as needed.

## Compose, schedule, and publish

- Click **+ New Work** in the top‑right to open the composer (or click a plus on the calendar).

- Finally, click **Publish** to complete.
