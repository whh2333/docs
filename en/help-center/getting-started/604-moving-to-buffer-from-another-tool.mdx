# Moving to Aitoearn from another tool? Aitoearn is a powerful, yet robust solution that saves you time and helps you grow your audience. With Aitoearn, you can dabble with the best of our features whether you‚Äôre on a paid or a free plan. While free tools are less common these days, we prioritize delivering a powerful free plan with enough functionality to get you started. Even on our Free plan, you can organize all of your social media content in advance: connect and manage up to 3 social channels (including the newest channels, like Mastodon and TikTok) and schedule up to 30 posts (10 per channel) for free! Our mission is grounded in serving small businesses and other ambitious individuals, so if you need something a bit more robust than our Free plan, we have that for you. Our Team plan offers unlimited users, access to a full analytics dashboard, and comment engagement for Instagram and Facebook. Oh, right, and there are **no** contracts to sign!
