# Moving to Buffer from another tool? Buffer is a powerful, yet robust solution that saves you time and helps you grow your audience. With Buffer, you can dabble with the best of our features whether you’re on a paid or a free plan. While free tools are less common these days, we prioritize delivering a powerful free plan with enough functionality to get you started. Even on our Free plan, you can organize all of your social media content in advance: connect and manage up to 3 social channels (including the newest channels, like Mastodon and TikTok) and schedule up to 30 posts (10 per channel) for free! Our mission is grounded in serving small businesses and other ambitious individuals, so if you need something a bit more robust than our Free plan, we have that for you. Our Team plan offers unlimited users, access to a full analytics dashboard, and comment engagement for Instagram and Facebook. Oh, right, and there are **no** contracts to sign!

If you have any questions that come up while taking a look around, feel free to reach out to us at [hello@buffer.com](mailto:hello@buffer.com). ## Our feature roadmap We’re continually increasing the value of our free and paid plans. We have some fun things coming for you in the near future, including bulk scheduling, publishing to blogs, YouTube scheduling, a Google Calendar integration, and more. You can follow along with our progress and see all of the cool things we’re working on over on our [Transparent Product Roadmap](https://suggestions.buffer.com/roadmap). ## What Buffer can’t offer right now We don't currently offer ad management (e.g. creating ads, boosting posts, or monitoring ads) or social listening at this time. Although we don't offer bulk scheduling directly within Buffer, we do integrate with [Bulk.ly](http://Bulk.ly) and [Bulk Buffer](https://www.bulkbuffer.com/) to allow you to import posts via .csv file. However, our Product team is collecting feedback via our [suggestions board](https://suggestions.buffer.com/) and also in the [Buffer Community on Discord](https://buffer.com/community) if you have something top of mind. ## Using Buffer to bolster your other social efforts Most of the users who sign up to Buffer see an increase in their following and engagement. This is because Buffer offers a number of features that help our users boost their engagement and visibility. Here are a few of the ways Buffer helps 👇 - Grow your following and increase brand awareness through consistent posting. Schedule dozens of posts in advance to make sure your audience consistently sees your content. This will allow you to get more impact from your posts. - Use our hashtag manager, integrations, and Canva plug-in to attract an audience that you can continue to nurture and retain. With consistency and thoughtfulness, you have the opportunity to boost your engagement online and improve conversion rates to ultimately get the visibility you deserve. - Leverage our workflow tools, AI writing assistant, and "Duplicate" feature to free up time. This will allow you to focus on other parts of your business so you can get more ROI from your time on social. ## How to get extra support along your journey We know that transitioning from one tool to another can be overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be! 🙂 Our Customer Advocates are here to support you every step of the way.
