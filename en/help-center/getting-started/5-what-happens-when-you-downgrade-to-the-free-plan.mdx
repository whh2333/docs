**⚠️ Feature-specific data**

- Team collaboration history is preserved but features are disabled

## How to Manage the Transition

### 1. **Review Your Channels**
If you have more than 3 channels, decide which ones are most important to keep active.

### 2. **Check Your Queue**
Review your scheduled posts and consider which ones are most important if you're over the 30-post limit.

### 3. **Download Reports**
Before downgrading, consider downloading any custom reports you want to keep.

### 4. **Inform Your Team**
Let team members know about the change and how it might affect their access.

在以下情况下，您的 Buffer 帐户可能会降级为免费计划：

您明确选择从付费计划降级为免费计划。
您已免费试用我们的付费计划，并且在试用期结束时不会升级。
如果您使用的是付费方案，但与帐户关联的信用卡已过期，或者付款失败。在这种情况下，我们会立即发送电子邮件通知，告知您付款失败，并在两周内重试付款三次。如果重试三次后仍未成功，帐户将自动降级为免费方案。
