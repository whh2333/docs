## How to Manage the Transition

### 1. **Review Your Channels**

### 2. **Check Your Queue**
Review your scheduled posts and consider which ones are most important if you're over the 30-post limit.

### 3. **Download Reports**
Before downgrading, consider downloading any custom reports you want to keep.

### 4. **Inform Your Team**
Let team members know about the change and how it might affect their access.
