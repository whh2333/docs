If your social channel is set to a different timezone than your computer is set to, the post will be reflected in your current timezone, but it will still publish at the correct time. For instance, if my post is scheduled to publish at 5pm on my London account, but I'm in EST, I'll see that post in my calendar is set to publish at 12pm EST (which is 5pm BST, London time). There isn't a way to see the timezone each social channel is set to from the calendar itself.</li> </ul> </div> <h2 id="Frequently-Asked-Questions-w4VKh">FAQ</h2> <h3>Can I schedule posts for multiple channels at once?</h3> <p>Yes, you can schedule a post for multiple channels by selecting the desired channels in the composer when creating your post.</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6880dda6c11e7d1454719178/file-VjjlggPP68.jpg" alt="Image of the Buffer composer with a LinkedIn and Facebook channel connected and an image of colorful sandals uploaded into the post" style="width: 546px; " /> <h3>Can I slide my posts to different time slots in my calendar?</h3> <p>You can reschedule posts from inside the Calendar by dragging &amp; dropping them to the desired new time and date.</p> <h3>Can I share a link to the calendar or subscribe to the calendar?</h3> <p>At this time, it is not possible to share the calendar with others or allow others to subscribe to your calendar.
