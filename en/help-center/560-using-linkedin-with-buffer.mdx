# Using LinkedIn with Buffer <a href="javascript:window.print()" class="printArticle" title="Print this article" aria-label="Print this Article"><i class="icon-print"></i></a> <p>Aside from the amazing professional network it provides, [LinkedIn](https://buffer.com/linkedin) is the number one platform for business-to-business (B2B) lead generation, with 80% of B2B leads coming from LinkedIn vs. 13% on X/Twitter and 7% on Facebook. That probably means we should get straight into how to use LinkedIn Pages and profiles with Buffer!</p> In this article: <li></li>[Connecting and refreshing your LinkedIn Page and profile](#01H84S2QQBHPC7W8Q3ZMV9X4YK)</li> <li></li>[Scheduling posts to LinkedIn Pages and profiles](#01H84S2QQBSAS8Y5JZDQ6XY54R)</li> <li></li>[Image, video, GIF, and document (PDF) specifications for LinkedIn](#01H84S2QQB2V90FXS3TB26Q481)</li> <li></li>[Engaging with LinkedIn posts](#01H84S2QQB8CXW0BFN3H9YQYHG)</li> <li></li>[LinkedIn analytics](#01H852CGSMMXZ5K2HVNYGRFSKB) <li></li>[Sent post analytics](#Sent-post-metrics-7yGIp)</li> <li></li>[Analyze analytics](#Analyze-analytics-XHuF3)</li> </li> <li></li>[LinkedIn error library](#01H852CGSMMXZ5K2HVNYGRFSKB)</li> <li></li>[Best practices for avoiding suspension when sharing to multiple profiles](#Best-practices-for-avoiding-suspension-when-sharing-to-multiple-profil-rjnP0)</li> ## These features are available for LinkedIn | **Publishing** | **Analytics** | **Engagement** | | | **‚úì **(Pages + profiles) | **‚úì **(Pages) | | | ## Connecting and refreshing your LinkedIn Page and profile <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìù **Note: **In order to connect a LinkedIn Page to Buffer, you must be set as a **Super Admin **of the page you're trying to connect.

To make sure Buffer knows which one you want to connect, log in to that LinkedIn account in another browser tab before trying to connect it to Buffer. <p>If your connected LinkedIn channel requires a refresh, check out the article [Refreshing a channel in Buffer](https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-buffer).</p> These are some LinkedIn channel considerations: | **Type of account** | **Buffer integration** | **Notes** | | | **LinkedIn Company Pages** | <td><p style="text-align: center;">**‚úì**</p></td> Authenticate via a LinkedIn profile that has Super Admin access for the Page. | | | **LinkedIn Showcase Pages** | <td><p style="text-align: center;">**‚úì**</p></td> Authenticate via a LinkedIn profile that has Super Admin access for the Page. | | | **LinkedIn profiles** | <td><p style="text-align: center;">**‚úì**</p></td> As long as the content you're sharing across profiles is unique, there should be no issue with connecting a large number of LinkedIn profiles to Buffer. | | | **LinkedIn groups** | | LinkedIn groups are not accessible for third-parties via LinkedIn's API. | | <div class="callout-blue"> <p>**Troubleshooting tip: **If your LinkedIn Page is not showing when you try to connect it to Buffer, verify that:</p> - you have [Super Admin access](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541981) of the page you're trying to connect to Buffer.</li> - you are logged into [LinkedIn.com](http://LinkedIn.com) with the account that has Super Admin access before trying to connect the Page to Buffer.</li> <p>**Note: **If you‚Äôre managing several LinkedIn pages across different Buffer accounts, it‚Äôs best to have one Super Admin connect the pages for each Buffer account.

LinkedIn is not supported within Buffer's engagement features at this time. ## LinkedIn analytics Publishing posts is one part of the equation, but how do we know if our strategy is resonating with our followers? That‚Äôs where your analytics come in. <p>There are two places to look for LinkedIn analytics in your Buffer account: the ***Sent ***tab of the ***Publish ***dashboard and the ***Analyze tab. ***</p> ### Sent post analytics <p>Within the ***Sent ***tab, you can access a quick view of your sent post metrics for both your LinkedIn Pages and profiles.</p> <p>**For LinkedIn profiles, you can access **<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-posts-within-your-publishing-dashboard">**the following analytics**</a>**: **</p> - Total impressions - Reactions - Comments - Shares - Engagement rate - Views - Watch time - Unique viewers (for profile video posts) <p>**For LinkedIn Pages, you can access the following analytics: **</p> - On our Free plan, you can access likes, comments, and impressions. <li></li><p>On [our paid plans](http://buffer.com/pricing), you can access likes, comments, impressions, shares, and engagement rate.</p>![LinkedIn Sent Posts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b67e3c48915f570c6a93ee/file-KM1AzWd81N.jpg)</li> ### Analyze analytics <p>If you're on our Essentials or Team plans, you can use the ***Analyze ***tab at the top of your dashboard to see more advanced analytics for your **LinkedIn Pages** (advanced analytics are not available for LinkedIn profiles at this time).

Once your post becomes the 501st newest post, we stop refreshing its data. - We are able to pull in metrics for LinkedIn sponsored posts. </div> ## LinkedIn error library <p>We don't currently have an error library for LinkedIn, but feel free to reach out to our Customer Advocates at [hello@buffer.com](mailto:hello@buffer.com) if you're hitting any errors.</p> ## Best practices for avoiding suspension when sharing to multiple profiles While it is technically possible to connect a large number of LinkedIn profiles to Buffer, this is not recommended and can result in issues like account suspension (on LinkedIn‚Äôs side). Social networks in general, but particularly LinkedIn and Facebook, have started to actively discourage personal profiles from being used for business and advertising purposes. They intend for personal profiles to be approached and treated as independent, personal accounts, where the content shared is authentic and created/shared by the owner of the profile. If the LinkedIn team notices that duplicate content is being shared to profiles, they will often suspend those accounts. Suspensions are usually temporary, but will happen over and over again if the behavior continues. <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìùDo you have a LinkedIn feature suggestion?
