(</li><a href="#What-is-the-difference-d6WM0">See the difference below</a>)</li> <li>You are logged into the wrong Facebook account. Log out of Facebook and use the right email address and password to access the correct Facebook account.</li> <li>Your Facebook profile doesn’t have Admin access to the Page. </li><a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/872-facebook-troubleshooting-guide" target="_self">See this guide to understand Admin access.</a></li> </ul> <h2 id="What-is-the-difference-d6WM0">What is the difference between Pages and profiles?</h2> <div> As mentioned above, everyone who has a Facebook account is already using a Facebook profile. When you have a Facebook profile, you can: </div> <ul> <li>create Facebook Pages</li> <li>convert your profile into a professional profile (but you cannot convert a profile into a Page!)</li> </ul> <div class="callout-red"> <div> ⚠️ Note: It’s important to understand that Buffer does not support Facebook profiles or professional profiles. We support Facebook Pages and groups. </div> </div> <div> Please see <a href="https://www.facebook.com/help/337881706729661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Facebook’s guide</a> for more information about the difference and what options you have with profiles, professional profiles and Pages. </div> <h2 id="How-can-I-tell-if-Im-using-a-Page-personal-profile-or-a-professiona-VVTsf">How can I tell if I'm using a Page, personal profile, or a professional profile?</h2> <div> The easiest way to tell if you are using a Facebook Page is by going to your page directly and looking under the name in the left-side bar for the Intro section. Here is what you will see, based on the type of account you have: </div> <p><b>Pages:</b></p> <p>In this section, you will see the word “Page” (<a href="https://share.buffer.com/RBuR7pNv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">as</a><a href="https://share.buffer.com/RBuR7pNv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener"> seen in this screenshot</a>) and you may see the page category.</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67fe6235188f663149109058/file-ikk31vgR6l.jpg" alt="Buffer Facebook Page intro section" style="width: 591px; " /> <p><b>Personal profiles</b></p> <p>Profiles will not have the word “Page” and will instead have a “Friends” tab under the main heading photo, like this:</p> <img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67f81e7082ae416567867d37/file-xzbjva5Y13.jpg" alt="Facebook Profile showing Friends tab" style="width: 653px; " /> <p><b>Professional profiles</b></p> <p>Professional profiles will not have the word “Page” or a “Friends” tab.
