Buffer offers both automatic publishing and notifications publishing (where you'll receive a notification and you can finish publishing your post in the Instagram app). To use automatic posting, images and videos must adhere to Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range.</p> <p>In this article:</p> <ol> <li></li><a href="#What-is-an-aspect-ratio-dEMQk" target="_self">What is an aspect ratio?</a></li> <li></li><a href="#h_01H9RQGFJC1JSCXADP3Y7NDJBF" target="_self">What are Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges?</a></li> <li></li><a href="#h_01H9RQGFJCQJM8ATBKZKDP3K0Y" target="_self">How are aspect ratios calculated? </a></li> <li></li><a href="#h_01H9RQGFJCJNZ7MP64RW82QE5Q" target="_self">What sizes do my images and videos need to be?</a></li> <li></li><a href="#What-size-will-Buffer-display-my-images--GwEMp">How will Buffer display my images? </a></li> </ol> <div class="callout-red"> <p>If you upload an image that falls outside the accepted aspect ratio ranges, you can use our editing tool to crop the image! <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/614-editing-your-images-in-buffer#01FNV15FWRZGB0A29QZ5Y24A7F">Here's more about editing your images in Buffer.&nbsp;</a></p> </div> <h2 id="What-is-an-aspect-ratio-dEMQk">What is an aspect ratio?</h2> <p>An aspect ratio describes the ratio between the image's width and height. Aspect ratios are often represented as two numbers separated by a colon, e.g. 4:5. This can be a convenient way of displaying an aspect ratio and can be converted into a numerical value by dividing the first by the second. So, for example, an aspect ratio written as 4:5 has a value of 4/5 = 0.8.</p> <h2 id="h_01H9RQGFJC1JSCXADP3Y7NDJBF">What are Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges?</h2> <p>The table below outlines the accepted aspect ratio ranges for both images and videos.</p> <table class="hs-table"> <tbody> <tr> <td>&nbsp;</td> <td><strong>Aspect ratio range&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></td> <td><strong>Aspect ratio range as numerical values</strong></td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Images</strong></td> <td>Between 4:5 and 1.91:1</td> <td>Between 0.8 and 1.91</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Stories</strong></td> <td>9:16 (suggested)</td> <td>0.56&nbsp;</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Reels</strong></td> <td><p>9:16 (recommended)*</p><p>*can accept between 0.01:1 and 10:1 but 9:16 is recommended to avoid cropping or blank spaces.</p></td> <td>0.56&nbsp;</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìù If your image or video is within the accepted aspect ratio range, your post can be published automatically. If the aspect ratio of your image or video falls outside of the range, your post will be scheduled as a notification instead. If you like, you can adjust the aspect ratio and then re-upload your image or video. For example, if your image has an aspect ratio of 1:2, it would fall outside of the accepted ratio range, so you would need to adjust the aspect ratio to get it to publish automatically.

Here are some examples:</p> <ul> <li>1200 x 1200 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/1200 = 1</li> <li>1200 x 1500 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/1500 = 0.8</li> <li>1200 x 629 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/629 = 1.907</li> </ul> <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìù Instagram is strict about the aspect ratio being&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;within their accepted range. They will not consider rounding to the closest number! For example, 1200 x 628 pixels would correspond to an aspect ratio of 1.910828, which falls outside of the acceptable range.</p> </div> <h2 id="h_01H9RQGFJCJNZ7MP64RW82QE5Q">What sizes do my images and videos need to be?</h2> <p>Your images or videos don't need to be a specific pixel size, as long as the aspect ratio is within the acceptable range. Here are some example sizes that would work nicely.</p> <div class="callout-blue"> <p>üìù Notes</p> <ul> <li>All videos posted to Instagram are now posted as Reels.

If the image you upload is larger than 8MB, we'll convert it to a smaller size (1920 pixels wide) to ensure it can be published. The minimum dimensions they accept is 150 x 150 pixels. Smaller images will be scaled up to the minimum.</p> </div> <h2 id="What-size-will-Buffer-display-my-images--GwEMp">How will Buffer display my images?</h2> <p>Instagram recently began introducing a new version of the grid which features a taller format <i>displaying </i>images at 3:4, however, the images still need to be <i>uploaded</i> at 4:5 in both Buffer and Instagram.
