<h2 id="h_d7bace96-7f52-4396-8f82-dda95ee284eb">General video upload requirements</h2>
<p>There are some specific guidelines for videos sent through Buffer to the various social networks. We'll give an overview here and then get more specific in each of the sections below.</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>File size:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li><i>100MB for Instagram</i></li>
   <li><i>10GB for YouTube Shorts</i></li>
   <li><i>40MB for Mastodon</i></li>
   <li><i>up to 1GB for Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, Threads</i></li>
  </ul></li>
 <li><strong>File format:</strong>
  <ul>
   <li><em>X/Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, and LinkedIn:</em> MP4, MOV, AVI, and M4V</li>
   <li><em>TikTok</em>: The video file formats accepted are MOV, MP4, or WEBM.</li>
   <li><em>Instagram and Threads</em>: MP4 and MOV</li>
   <li><em>YouTube Shorts:</em> .mov, .mp4, .mpg, .mpeg, .avi, .WebM</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>
<p>The video you upload will be converted to MP4 encoded with H264, and a maximum resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels (HD). Larger files are likely to be compressed to ensure they can be posted to the social network, but quality loss should be minimal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we can't support Apple ProRes or raw camera formats like ARRI and RED.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY9S79H6K9F255CJDWB">Why is my video taking a while to upload?</h3>
<p>When a video file is uploaded, there are a few steps the file needs to go through, including checking the file to ensure it can be passed over through the API, having AWS (Amazon Web Services) transcode the file, and generating potential thumbnails. When generating thumbnails, we look for a different thumbnail every 15 seconds. This means that for a video that is 30 minutes long, we would try to generate at least 120 different images. This can be a key factor that affects the upload speed.</p>
<p>Depending on the file size, the length of the video, and the connection speed, each of these things could take different lengths of time and determine how long the overall process takes.</p>
<h2 id="h_038ca001-4c5c-4ae6-a773-92a9dedb22b1">Choosing thumbnails and titles</h2>
<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY9W8C5B7T91T67P23N">Choosing a title for your video</h3>
<p>For Facebook, once your video has finished uploading, you can edit the video title in the field below the video.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65a6e1b069979704a279a2c4/file-N9MHe5aoDp.jpg" alt="Buffer Publishing Video Title for Facebook" style="width: 471.988px; "></p>
<h3 id="Choosing-a-thumbnail-from-your-video-gT-D7">Choosing a thumbnail from your video</h3>
<p>At this time, we do not support uploading an image for your video thumbnail. However, for Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, you can choose a thumbnail from the video you've uploaded. By default, the first frame of the video (0 seconds) will be used as the thumbnail. If you'd like to change your thumbnail, you'll follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Once your video has finished uploading, click <em><strong>Edit Thumbnail</strong></em><em>,</em></li>
 <li>Drag the slider to the position in the video you'd like to use as the cover/thumbnail image.</li>
 <li>Click <em><strong>Save</strong></em>.</li>
</ol>

<div class="callout-blue">
 <h4 id="h_01HCZ16PY9NRKVQC71A9JC77N5">üìù Good-to-Knows</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>Thumbnails can only be edited for TikTok, Pinterest and Instagram posts, and Instagram Reels.</li>
  <li>The "Edit Thumbnail" button will not show up if your post is scheduled as a notification or if you have <i><b>Enable Notifications by default</b></i> turned on within your Buffer Instagram Settings.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01HCZ16PY9Q25YK8AWZM0TA8WH">How thumbnails and titles are used on each social network</h2>
<p>Since videos appear and behave a little differently on each social network, the thumbnail and title you choose will only be used in certain places.</p>
<table class="hs-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Facebook</strong></td>
   <td>Many Facebook users choose to auto-play videos (this is a Facebook setting toggled here: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=media). Users who have this setting toggled on will not see a video thumbnail. Unfortunately, in places where a thumbnail is shown, Facebook does not use the thumbnail you have chosen in Buffer. However, the title you enter will be displayed at the top of the video post.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Instagram</strong></td>
   <td>Videos on Instagram play automatically on the home screen feed, which means thumbnails are redundant in that location. Therefore, any custom thumbnail you choose will not be displayed there. However, the custom thumbnail will be used as the cover of your video on your Instagram profile grid.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>X/Twitter</strong></td>
   <td>Videos (whether within <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X's/Twitter's permitted file limits</a> or not) do not play automatically. Unfortunately, X/Twitter does not use the thumbnail you have chosen in Buffer. However, the custom title will be used if the video is <em>outside</em> of X's/Twitter's permitted file limits, in which case the video will be displayed as a link to Buffer's video player.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>LinkedIn</strong></td>
   <td>Videos published on LinkedIn will appear natively and automatically play in the feed. Our&nbsp;LinkedIn&nbsp;integration&nbsp;does not currently support custom thumbnails.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Pinterest</strong></td>
   <td>Videos on Pinterest will play automatically unless a user has set their preferences within Pinterest otherwise, so adding a thumbnail/cover image could be helpful. The title of the video will be shown at the bottom of the video in the feed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>TikTok</strong></td>
   <td>Videos on TikTok will play automatically in the feed.&nbsp;You can select a frame from your video to use as the thumbnail on TikTok.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>YouTube Shorts</b></td>
   <td>YouTube currently doesn't support custom thumbnails through Buffer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Mastodon</b></td>
   <td>Custom thumbnails are not supported for Mastodon in Buffer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Threads</b></td>
   <td>Videos on Threads will play automatically in the feed. Custom thumbnails are not supported at this time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Bluesky</b></td>
   <td>Custom thumbnails are not supported for Bluesky in Buffer.</td>
  </tr>

</div>
<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY91ZA0YFNJ1YGNKFZR">Video link</h3>
<p>Instagram does not currently support hyperlinks within captions. Therefore, if you include a link to a video within the composer, it will not be hyperlinked once published. Instead, it would be published as plain text. Users could copy and paste the link from the caption to a new browser window, which would take them to the video. Additionally, when scheduling a post for Instagram, you're required to upload either an image or a video. Therefore, after dropping the link into the composer, you'll still need to choose or upload an image to accompany it. For these reasons, this method is not commonly used. Instead, we would recommend using the upload option described above.</p>

<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY95ZNH3YVFHNTTCPTQ">Video upload</h3>
<p>Videos appear natively once published to X/Twitter, if they are within <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-videos#FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">X's/Twitter‚Äôs permitted file limits</a> of 512MB and between .5 seconds to 140 seconds long.

<h3>X/Twitter video requirements:</h3>
<p><b>File size: </b>up to 1GB</p>

<p><b>Length: </b>between .5 seconds to 140 seconds long</p>

<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY95ZPP39T95W813BND">Video upload</h3>
<p>Videos published through Buffer to LinkedIn will play automatically in a user's feed if they are within the following limits:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a424737/video-ads-advertising-specifications?lang=en" target="_self">LinkedIn's video requirements</a></p>

<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY9VTG5Y9QMFGGTJ3EE">Video link</h3>
<p>Your post will include a link preview. TikTok videos will play automatically within the post itself, while YouTube videos will link out to YouTube.</p>

<h2 id="h_8d5a2ee2-7c08-43a9-bd2f-79a149cdd811">How videos appear on Pinterest</h2>
<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY91M23CHX1SZV4R7RC">Video upload</h3>
<p>Because Buffer supports video pins on Pinterest business and personal accounts, your video will play automatically as your followers scan through their feed. The exception to this would be if the follower changed their preferences within Pinterest to prevent automatic video play.</p>
<p>If your video plays automatically for a user, your thumbnail/cover image will display as a static image when the video ends. If the user has chosen not to have videos play automatically, your thumbnail/cover image will display in their feed before clicking to play the video.</p>
<h3><b>Pinterest video requirements</b></h3>
<p><b>Length: </b>between 4 seconds and 15 minutes in length</p>
<p><b>Aspect ratio: </b>1:1 (square - suggested) or vertical videos with the aspect rations of 2:3, 4:5, or 9:16</p>
<p>There are a couple of other pieces to note around your Pinterest video uploads. First, videos can be between 4 seconds and 15 minutes in length. Also, <a href="https://help.pinterest.com/en/business/article/video-pins">Pinterest suggests</a> using square videos (1:1), or vertical videos with the aspect rations of 2:3, 4:5, or 9:16.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499a06241295a81ba6dc2/img-1662243-1695848859-454047329.png" alt="Pinterest video pink leading to Buffer Stories Creator" style="width: 364.991px; "></p>
<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY9S4ZD2QN2N2TDHPTF">Video link</h3>
<p>When scheduling a post for Pinterest, you can choose to use your destination link (formerly known as source link) to point to any URL, including a URL that leads to a video. Whichever destination link you use, Pinterest does require that you upload either an image or a video to the post. Therefore, after dropping the link into the <em><strong>Destination link</strong></em> field, you'll still need to choose or upload an image to accompany it. Once published, your image or video pin will be displayed, and when users click on it, they will be sent to the destination link you included in the <em><strong>Destination link</strong></em> field when composing your post.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499a16241295a81ba6dc3/img-1662243-1695848859-563439710.png" alt="Pinterest pin with an image of the Stories Creator logo" style="width: 100%; "></p>

<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY9Z7FBX6DBTS7MZVSF">Video Upload</h3>
<p>Your TikTok videos will play automatically in the feed. However, if you've selected a frame in Buffer using the <i><b>Edit Thumbnail </b></i>option, it will appear as the video's thumbnail on your profile.</p>
<h3 id="h_01HCZ16PY9HFFGCHG9ZMQANS0E">TikTok video Requirements</h3>
<p><strong>Media type:</strong> Video only (TikTok posts cannot be created without a video attached)</p>
<p><strong>Videos per post:</strong> 1&nbsp;</p>

If you'd like to create a video with the TikTok app, you can save the video to your device before uploading it to Buffer by first publishing it privately.
