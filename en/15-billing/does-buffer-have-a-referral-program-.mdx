        <p>While we don’t have a formal referral/affiliate program, we do have an easy way to share Buffer with your friends and network. By inviting others, you’ll also support Buffer's growth, allowing us to continue improving the service.</p>
<p>If you’d like to help your friends elevate their social &amp; organic marketing with a free Buffer account, here are the steps:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard.</li>
 <li>Select&nbsp;<em><strong>Refer a friend.</strong></em></li>
 <li><p>Find the unique referral link for your organization like this:</p><p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a724096a5904277134465e/file-mOWDTdqGYc.jpg" alt="Buffer Account Settings - Refer a friend" style="max-width: 100%; "></p><br></li>
 <li>Click <strong><em>Copy </em></strong>and share your link with someone who’d enjoy using Buffer or click&nbsp;<strong><em>Share Now&nbsp;</em></strong>to create a post with the link in Buffer to share to your social channels.&nbsp;</li>
 <li>Your friend signs up for their free Buffer account. Thanks so much for your interest in telling others about Buffer!</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>For information about our legacy referral program, please see below.</strong></p>
<p><em>As of February 2018, we have discontinued our original referral program, which allotted extra queue slots in Buffer publishing if someone signed up using your personal referral link. Any earned queue slots from the program will be honored until further notice. We appreciate everyone who participated over the years!</em></p>
