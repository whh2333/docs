        <p>Our Free plan is limited to 3 social channels with some limited publishing tools. To work with 4 or more channels, you'll need to subscribe to a paid plan, which then unlocks all of our advanced publishing, analytics and engagement tools.</p>
<p>On our paid plans, you can add as many social channels as you need since we charge on a per-channel basis. If you upgrade from the Free plan, you'd pay per social channel that you have connected, <strong>including the 3 that you already have connected</strong>. Once you upgrade, our advanced tools are unlocked for all channels.</p>
<p>Our current pricing can be found at <a href="https://buffer.com/pricing">https://buffer.com/pricing</a></p>
<p>We have a chart to break down which features come with each plan <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-buffer-plan" target="_self">here</a>.</p>
