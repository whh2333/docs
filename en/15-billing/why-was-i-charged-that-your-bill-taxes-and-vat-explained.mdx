<h2 id="h_01FBWJ5H0A1XR530YG5TA2G6MV">An overview of your Buffer invoice</h2>
<p>Buffer pricing is based upon the exact number of social channels you have connected to your account at any given time, so you only pay for what you need. Every time you connect or disconnect a social channel from Buffer, your invoice will automatically adjust and your credit card will automatically be charged for the new total.</p>
<p>Your Buffer invoice will include the total amount paid for the billing period, as well as all individual adjustments to your bill. Each adjustment to your pricing for adding or removing channel slots will be reflected as a line item in your invoice.</p>
<p>Also on your invoice, you‚Äôll see any credits or discounts applied to that month.</p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù <b>Notes:</b></p>
 <ul>
  <li>Download your invoices and receipts from the <a href="https://account.buffer.com/billing" target="_blank">Billing area of your account</a>.</li>
  <li>Your billing dates always remain the same, even if your plan was altered by adding or removing channel slots.</li>
  <ul>
   <li>Example: If you are on a monthly plan and your free trial moved to the paid plan on March 17th, your bill will always come on the 17th of each month. If you are on the annual plan, and your free trial moved to the paid annual plan on January 21st, your billing period would always be January 21st of this year through January 20th of the following year.</li>
  </ul>
 </ul>

<h2 id="h_01FBWJ5P9Q51EPTAQP3S5XT8DR">Billing for customers paying monthly</h2>
<p>As a customer paying monthly, whenever you add a new channel, you'll be charged immediately.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBWRA2P0V3PC5NSV1XFVR46S">Billing for customers paying annually</h2>
<p>While the payment for additional social channels added to a monthly plan show on the next month's bill, changes to your annual plan result in an immediate charge. If paying annually, whenever you add a new social channel, you‚Äôll immediately be charged a prorated amount for that channel in order to pay for that channel‚Äôs use across the remainder of your billing period.</p>
<p>As an example, if you are on the Team plan, your social channels are each $120/year. If you start your billing period on June 1st with five social channels connected, your bill will be $600 for the year.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs say that six months later, on December 1st, you connect three more social channels. Right then, you will be charged for the prorated use of those social channels between December 1st and the end of your billing period; June 1st. Since we‚Äôre using nice clean numbers here, each of those three new social channels would come out to exactly half of the normal annual social channel cost, which is $60 each. The total, then, on December 1st would come to $180.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs look at a real example:</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499e55416dd630a4b06c0/img-1655699-1695848933-741995491.png" alt="Buffer annual invoice with two lines - the remaining time on the plan with 5 channels and the unused time on the plan with 4 channels" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<p>This customer started their annual plan on June 29th with four social channels. On July 27th, they added one more social channel, to equal five total social channels on their annual plan.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a breakdown of those line items:</p>
<ol>
 <li>The first line item is the prorated charge for the remainder of the year on a Team plan for 5 social channels. The prorated cost from July 27th through June 29th of the following year is $554.57.</li>
 <li>The second line item reflects the subtraction of the original plan, which was the&nbsp; Team plan for four social channels. The prorated deduction from July 27th to June 29th of the following year comes out to -$443.65.</li>
</ol>
<p>When those two line items are added together, the final mid-billing period payment is created. The final cost for this customer to add an additional social channel to their existing annual plan came to $110.92.</p>
<h2 id="h_01FBWRP6XZEVFW16BJ7MNXKNRP">What happens when I disconnect social channels?</h2>
<p>If you're disconnecting a channel, make sure to <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/539-adding-or-removing-a-channel-slot-from-buffer" target="_self">remove the channel slot</a> from your billing plan.</p>
<p>On the monthly and annual plans, we will schedule the reduction in channels to occur at your next billing date.</p>
<h2 id="What-currency-am-I-billed-in--D7zsQ">What currency does Buffer bill in?</h2>
<p>All Buffer subscriptions are billed in U.S. dollars (USD), regardless of your location. At this time, it's not possible to change the billing currency or pay in a different currency.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôre outside the U.S., your bank or card provider will handle the currency conversion. It could be helpful to understand how your bank handles conversions and whether or not they apply any additional fees.</p>
