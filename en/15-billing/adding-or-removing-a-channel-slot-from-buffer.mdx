<p>The cost of your subscription plan is based on the total number of channel slots available for your account.</p>
<p><b>What counts as a channel? </b>Each social account you connect is a channel. For instance, a Facebook Page, Facebook Group, X/Twitter profile, Linked Page and Linked Profile would count as 5 channels.</p>
<p><b>How many channel slots should you purchase?</b> Well, one social channel fits into each channel slot. For instance, if I have a Facebook Page, a LinkedIn profile, and a Facebook group, I’ll purchase three channel slots.</p>
<p><b>How can I add or remove channels slots? </b>Follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click <em><strong>Channels</strong></em> from the drop down menu.</li>
 <li>Click <em><strong>Add or Remove Channels</strong></em> on the top of the page.</li>
