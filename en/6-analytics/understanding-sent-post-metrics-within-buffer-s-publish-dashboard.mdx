        <p>The <em><strong>Sent</strong></em>&nbsp;tab within your publishing dashboard provides a history of all of your published posts. Looking at your posts individually allows you to draw comparisons and see patterns around which posting times are working best for you and what type of content your audience is most engaged with.</p>

<ul>
 <li><i>While you can see past notifications within the Sent tab, you will not be able to view post metrics. </i></li>
 <li><i>We are unable to pull in native posts for Instagram Personal accounts at this time. </i></li>

<ul>
 <li><i>X/Twitter sent post analytics are only available for </i><a href="https://buffer.com/pricing" target="_blank"><i>our current plans</i></a><i> and are not available on legacy plans. </i></li>
 <li><i>Data for posts published natively on X/Twitter are fetched daily and can take up to 24 hours to appear in the Sent tab of Publish. Native post metrics may appear as "0" until the data is fetched. Posts published through Buffer will appear immediately. </i></li>
 <li><i>We are only able to pull in 100 sent posts per day on X/Twitter. If you are publishing more than 100 posts per day natively and via Buffer, we will prioritize pulling in posts published through Buffer first (therefore, native posts may be missing). </i></li>

<h2 id="h_af59721f-6a1b-4e3c-93c9-1d9f539178e1">How to share posts again</h2>
<p>With so much content on social media now, posts can easily get missed and lost in the flow, and we understand that you need to get maximum visibility. The <i><b>Duplicate</b></i> feature allows you to add published posts back into your queue to share a second time. Due to social networks becoming much stricter on the duplication of content, we recommend using this feature lightly, and making changes to your post text or image before sharing them multiple times.&nbsp;You can find guidance on resharing posts in the article: <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/647-is-it-possible-to-schedule-one-post-to-repeat-multiple-times" target="_blank">Is it possible to schedule one post to repeat multiple times?</a></p>
<p>To duplicate a post:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Find the post you want to duplicate within the Sent tab.</li>
 <li>Click the three dots in the bottom right corner of the post.</li>
 <li>Select <i><b>Duplicate</b></i>.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b64f698919a15d1b1d2a40/file-523ShvjcMc.jpg" alt="Sent post with arrow pointing to three dot menu (Share Link in a Post, Copy Link, Duplicate options visible)" style="width: 638.984px; "></p>

 <li>The composer should open. Select the channels you'd like to post to, make any changes to your post, and schedule it to complete the process.</li>

<h2 id="h_9575ebf2-62d6-4f13-9f82-d4ccaa6f880d">FAQ</h2>
<h3>Are native posts included in the Sent tab?</h3>
<div>
 We’re able to pull in native posts for Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, Pinterest, and LinkedIn Pages for Free customers.&nbsp;
</div>
<div>
 On <a href="http://buffer.com/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">our paid plans</a>, we pull in native posts for Facebook, Instagram, Mastodon, LinkedIn Pages, Pinterest, and X/Twitter.
</div>
<h3>How far back does the data go?</h3>
<p>When you <b>initially connect a channel </b>to Buffer, we'll backfill the following amount of native post data:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Facebook: 50 posts</li>
 <li>LinkedIn: 50 posts</li>
 <li>Threads: 50 posts</li>
 <li>Bluesky: 50 posts</li>
 <li>Mastodon: 50 posts</li>
 <li>TikTok: 25 posts</li>
 <li>Instagram: the last 30 days of posts (excluding Stories)</li>
 <li>X/Twitter: 100 posts created in the last 30 days (paid plans &amp; trials only)</li>
 <li>Pinterest: 250 pins from up to 1000 boards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, going forward, we'll show the following amount of <b>post history: </b></p>
<ul>
 <li>On the Free plan, you'll see a history of posts from the past 30 days.</li>
 <li>On our paid plans, you'll see a history of posts from the past 2 years.</li>
 <li><strong>Please note that we'll show posts that have been sent since you added your social channel to Buffer</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Will deleted posts still appear in the Sent tab?</h3>
<p>Yes. The Sent tab is a record of all posts sent through Buffer, so a post will still appear in the Sent tab even if the published post has been deleted on the social network.</p>
<h3>Is it possible to view all of my published posts in one view?</h3>
<p>Yes, you can view all of your published posts in one list using the All Channels view. <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/861-how-to-use-the-all-channels-view-in-buffer">Learn more about How to use the All Channels view in Buffer here</a>.</p>
<h3>How can I delete or edit a published post?</h3>
<p>At this time, we are unable to edit or delete a post once it's been published through Buffer. Instead, you'll need to edit or delete the published post directly on the social network. You can find a history of your published posts&nbsp;<a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-posts-within-your-publishing-dashboard">within the Sent tab of the Publish dashboard</a>.</p>
<h3>Why are the analytics for my sent post showing as dashes or zero?</h3>
<p>It may take some time for analytics data to sync and appear. If it persists, ensure your channel is properly connected and authenticated.</p>
<h3>Will the sent posts show who created the post?</h3>
<p>Yes, posts in the Sent tab include information on which user created the post and when.</p>
