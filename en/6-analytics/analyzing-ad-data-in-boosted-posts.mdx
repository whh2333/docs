<p>The permissions that Buffer needs in order to pull in boosted posts data will be granted during the process of connecting a Facebook page or Instagram business account. If you aren't seeing up-to-date information there, you can refresh the connection by following the steps below.</p>
<ol>
 <li>Click on your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then click&nbsp;<i><b>Account</b></i>&nbsp;from the drop-down menu.</li>
 <li>Click the&nbsp;<i><b>Channels</b></i>&nbsp;option from the menu on the left-hand side of your screen.</li>
 <li>Click the three-dot menu icon to the right of the channel you'd like to refresh.</li>
 <li>Click&nbsp;<i><b>Refresh Connection</b></i>.</li>
</ol>

 <h4>üìù Notes</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>When you connect a new channel, we will backfill the last 90 days of boosted posts and you should see that data within a few minutes. After that, the data will be updated approximately every six hours.</li>
  <li>We always exclude the current day's data to avoid showing partial data for the current day. We suggest checking back the next day for the previous day's data.</li>
 </ul>

<p>If your ad data still is not displaying on boosted posts after refreshing your connection, there may be another underlying issue that's preventing Buffer from pulling your boosted post metrics properly. Once you've verified that all permissions have been accepted for ads (which can be done by checking your settings on the respective social account), some good next steps would be to check the following:</p>
<ol>
 <li>Was the post boosted using the same Facebook Profile that authorized Buffer access for the ad data?</li>
 <li>Additionally, are you boosting these posts from Facebook Business Manager or Ads Manager?</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="Selecting-the-right-date-range-to-see-your-boosted-posts-data-wP4ig">Selecting the right date range to see your boosted posts data</h2>
<p>If you're analyzing your boosted posts, there are situations where you might see boosted results under the Post Summary table but not under the Post Insights table.</p>
<p>The Post Summary table shows the results of posts published and posts boosted during the selected date range. The Post Insights table shows the posts published during the selected date range, regardless of when they were boosted. This is why you might see posts that have had a $ spend on them, even though the results of that boost are not included in the summary table.</p>
<p>Example: You published a post on July 1 and boosted it from August 1 to August 5. To see the overall results of the boosted post under the Post Summary table, the date range should include August 1 to August 5, when the post was boosted. To see the specific boosted post under the Post Insights table, the date range you select should include July 1, when the original post was published.</p>
