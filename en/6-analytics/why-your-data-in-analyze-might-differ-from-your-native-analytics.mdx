<h2 id="h_01EKW2WRER9XV7HMP3J77G4NYD">Backfilling data for all channels</h2>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üí° <b>Quick info:</b></p>
 <p><b>Q: I just connected my account but I can't see my analytics for my pages. Why?</b></p>
 <p><b>A: </b>Data is not collected in real time, and is instead collected in batches from each social network's API each day. In some cases, it can take up to 24 hours for new post data to be populated. Check back in a day or two and you'll see data!</p>
 <p><b>Q: Can I compare my data year over year?</b></p>
 <p>A: Currently, our platform allows you to compare data with the previous period, but it does not support automatic year-over-year comparisons for any selected period. However, once you've been using Buffer for over a year, you can select the current year as the date range in the analytics dashboard to view metrics and then create custom reports to compare with the previous year's data. Learn more about <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/534-creating-custom-analytics-reports" target="_blank">Creating custom analytics reports here</a>.</p>
</div>
<ol>
 <li>When you first connect a social channel, we will backfill a certain amount of data, as described in the tables below.&nbsp;<em>More comprehensive details on this are available in the channel specific sections below.</em></li>
 <li>If your social channel is disconnected, your latest data won‚Äôt be populating, so you‚Äôll want to get that connection reestablished by&nbsp;following the steps in the article: <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/573-refreshing-a-channel-in-buffer">Refreshing a channel in Buffer</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Post data</b></p>
<p>When it comes to posts and post analytics (e.g. showing a list of your past posts, or how your individual posts perform), we're able to backfill the following amount of data:</p>
<table class="hs-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><b>Channel</b></td>
   <td><b>Backfill information</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Facebook</td>
   <td>50 posts are backfilled, not including stories data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Instagram</td>
   <td>30 days of Instagram data is backfilled, not including stories data.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>LinkedIn</td>
   <td>50 posts are backfilled, not including video posts.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>X/Twitter</td>
   <td>up to 100 posts from the last 30 days of Twitter data are backfilled.</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
<p><b>Channel data</b></p>
<p>Channel data includes metrics such as New Followers, Audience/Demographic data, etc. For channel metrics, we're able to backfill the following amount of data:</p>
<table class="hs-table">
 <tbody>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>Channel</strong></td>
   <td><strong>Backfill information</strong></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Facebook</td>
   <td><p>Six months of data is backfilled, not including the following audience/demographic data:</p>
    <ul>
     <li>engaged users</li>
     <li>Top age and gender based on 'Your Fans' (age and gender is still available for 'People Reached')</li>
    </ul></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Instagram</td>
   <td>Six months of data is backfilled.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>X/Twitter</td>
   <td>We're not able to backfill channel data at this time.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>LinkedIn</td>
   <td>Six months of data is backfilled.</td>
  </tr>
 </tbody>
</table>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>üìù For Free Plan users who would like to do a trial of a <a href="http://buffer.com/pricing" target="_blank">paid plan</a>, the posts you've published while on Buffer's Free Plan will backfill in your analytics dashboard during your trial period.</p>
</div>
<h2 id="h_01EKW2WVPT96AXKGG2J12E74W2">Facebook</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Due to API limitations, we are only able to pull data into Buffer for Facebook accounts that have 100 or more fans. Whilst it's technically possible to connect Facebook accounts that have fewer than 100 fans, no data will be available.</li>
 <li>Six months of Facebook data is backfilled when you connect your account to Buffer. This could result in data for previous periods appearing lower than in Facebook Insights. Let‚Äôs say your Facebook account was connected on October 1, 2019. We‚Äôd go back and fetch data starting from April 1 2019. In January 2020, if you looked at your data in Buffer for the whole year of 2019, it wouldn‚Äôt match what you see in Facebook Insights for 2019 because we are only capturing nine months of data (the six months prior to connecting the account, which is the data we‚Äôve backfilled, and the three months after connecting the account).</li>
 <li>Audience information for Facebook will take up to 24 hours to populate.</li>
 <li>Data on individual Facebook posts will not be updated indefinitely. After a full calendar month has passed, we will no longer update the metrics for that post.</li>
 <li>Due to recent updates from Meta, we are no longer able to ingest data for number of post clicks, impressions, engaged users, and gender or age demographics for your Facebook Page.</li>
 <li>We do not support Facebook Reels data within our analytics dashboard. However, you can view metrics for published Reels within our <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-posts-within-your-publishing-dashboard">basic analytics in the publishing dashboard</a>.</li>
 <li>We do not pull in Facebook Stories data at this time.</li>
 <li>Ads created through Facebook Ads Manager are not included at the moment.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01EKW2X08SJ19BVQ3R2S0X9ZQT">Instagram</h2>
<ol>
 <li>Due to API limitations, we are only able to pull Instagram data into Buffer for business accounts that have 100 or more followers. Whilst it's technically possible to connect business accounts that have fewer than 100 followers, no data will be available.</li>
 <li>30 days of Instagram data is backfilled when you connect your account to Buffer.</li>
 <li>Whilst we're able to backfill 30 days of Instagram post metrics when you connect your account, unfortunately, we‚Äôre not able to backfill Instagram stories. We are only able to start collecting that data from when your Instagram account is connected. Additionally, if your Instagram account becomes disconnected from Buffer, any stories you post during the time that it is disconnected will unfortunately not be pulled into Buffer.</li>
 <li>We are not able to backfill follower counts for Instagram. Instead, we provide an approximation of the previous growth on the account based on the current growth. To do this, we will look at the follower count from the past day, as well as the current follower count, and generate a graph of what growth could have looked like in the past (found in the <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/526-performance-overview">Performance Overview</a> in your&nbsp;<i><b>Overview</b></i> tab). If you experienced larger fluctuations in follower counts (e.g. losing or gaining 100 followers) in a single day, the graph would not represent that and would instead reflect a smoother estimate based on the data we‚Äôre able to see when the account was connected.</li>
 <li>Audience information for Instagram will take up to 24 hours to populate. We are not able to backfill audience&nbsp;data, and are only able to start collecting this information from when the channel was connected to Buffer.</li>
 <li>We are only able to pull in impressions, the number of likes, and the number of comments for Instagram Reels due to limitations with Instagram's API. We are not able to pull in other Reels metrics at this time.</li>
 <li>We are not able to pull in data on IGTV posts.</li>
 <li>Data on individual Instagram posts will not be updated indefinitely. After a full calendar month has passed, we will no longer update the metrics for that post.</li>
 <li>The Instagram stories displayed will only be those that are original content and do not include posts and reels shared to your stories. Additionally, Buffer will not display any information on reshared stories.</li>
 <li>We are not able to pull in data for collaboration posts.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01EKW2YHS8XDY3RH8XTC9F6B0D">X/Twitter</h2>
<ol>
 <li>30 days of X/Twitter data is backfilled when you connect your account to Buffer. This means that your data won‚Äôt match what you see in X/Twitter Analytics when you‚Äôre looking at a time period 30 days prior to the account being connected. Let‚Äôs say your X/Twitter account was connected on October 1, 2019. In January 2020, if you looked at your data in Buffer for the whole year of 2019, it wouldn‚Äôt match what you see in X/Twitter Analytics for 2019 because we are only capturing four months of data (the 30 days prior to connecting the account, which is the data we‚Äôve backfilled, and the three months after connecting the account).</li>
 <li>Natively published posts can take up to 24 hours to appear within Analyze. Posts published by Buffer will appear immediately. (Natively published posts may show with '0' metrics until we have fetched the data).</li>
 <li>We are able to ingest data for 100 posts per day across natively published posts and posts published via Buffer. If scheduling more than 100 posts per day, all posts published through Buffer will appear in Analyze, however, some natively published posts may be missed.</li>
 <li>We are not able to backfill follower counts for X/Twitter. Follower counts will start populating when you connect your account to Buffer.</li>
 <li>Data on individual posts will not be updated indefinitely. After 20 days have passed, we will no longer update the metrics for that post.</li>
 <li>The number of posts you‚Äôve shared, which is shown in the&nbsp;<i><b>Posts</b></i> tab and in your <i><b>Overview</b></i> tab, will not include replies or reposts. X/Twitter Analytics do include replies and reposts, so these numbers may differ.&nbsp;Learn more about the Posts tab in the article <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/527-analyzing-your-posts-within-your-analytics-dashboard" target="_self">Analyzing posts within your analytics dashboard</a>, and learn more about the Overview tab in the article <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/526-performance-overview">Performance Overview</a>.</li>
 <li>When you share an X/Twitter thread, we are only able to pull in data for the first post but not the subsequent ones so your X/Twitter Analytics will not include data on subsequent posts in the thread.</li>
 <li>The engagement and engagement rate stats you see within your analytics dashboard will likely be a bit lower than what you see in X/Twitter Analytics. This is because the X/Twitter API version that we are using does not offer an aggregated engagements number for each post. Therefore, we are calculating the engagements ourselves, using a sum of likes, replies, reposts, quotes, link clicks, and profile clicks. Other engagement types, such as app opens, app install attempts, and hashtag clicks, are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;included.&nbsp;The engagement stats in X/Twitter Analytics on the other hand, will include all types of engagement.</li>
 <li>Boosted X/Twitter ads are not included at the moment. If this is something you'd like to see us support, let us know by&nbsp;<a href="https://suggestions.buffer.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">submitting a feature suggestion.</a></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="h_01EQGX11SR3M4D1PPDJG97CRS6">LinkedIn</h2>
<ol>
 <li>At this time, Analyze only supports LinkedIn pages and does not support LinkedIn profiles. To find post metrics for your LinkedIn profiles, <a href="https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-posts-within-your-publishing-dashboard">you can visit the Sent tab of the Publish dashboard</a>.</li>
 <li>We fetch the metrics of the last 500 posts. If posts beyond this number keep on generating metrics, after they are pushed back from the 500th position, we won‚Äôt be showing those posts in the metrics.</li>
 <li>Our analytics support LinkedIn posts with multiple image files but not LinkedIn carousel posts that feature slideshows created with PDF files.</li>
 <li>We are able to pull in metrics for LinkedIn sponsored posts.</li>
 <li>We are unable to pull in metrics for reposts.</li>
