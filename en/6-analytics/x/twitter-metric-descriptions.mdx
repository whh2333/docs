  <li>X/Twitter sent post analytics are only available for <a href="https://buffer.com/pricing" target="_blank">our current plans</a> and are not available on legacy plans.</li>
  <li>Data for posts published natively on X/Twitter are fetched daily and can take up to 24 hours to appear in the Sent tab of Publish. Native post metrics may appear as "0" until the data is fetched. Posts published through Buffer will appear immediately.</li>
  <li>We are only able to pull in 100 sent posts per day on X/Twitter. If you are publishing more than 100 posts per day natively and via Buffer, we will prioritize pulling in posts published through Buffer first (therefore, native posts may be missing).</li>
