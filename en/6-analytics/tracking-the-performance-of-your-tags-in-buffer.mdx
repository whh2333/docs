<div class="callout-blue">
 <h4 id="01EKCN8JGXRDZA76VH9EDPMVFN">Notes</h4>
 <ul>
  <li>It's not possible to choose a date range for your tag report; the metrics shown are across the entire tag period.</li>
  <li>We currently show boosted metrics in the tag post breakdown area, but not in the tag pulse or tag post metrics areas.</li>
  <li>While it's possible to create posts within a tag for Facebook groups, LinkedIn profiles, Pinterest boards, YouTube, Mastodon, Start Page, and Google Business Profiles, <strong>it won't be possible to track the metrics for those</strong> within these reports. You'll be able to view tag analytics for posts shared to Facebook Pages, Instagram business accounts, X/Twitter profiles, and LinkedIn Pages. Instagram posts that are scheduled as notifications also won't appear in tag analytics. You can see more about our <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/567-supported-channels" target="_self">supported channels and analytics capabilities here</a>.</li>
  <li>Although you can add multiple tags to a post, each tag's metrics are independent and reflect the total followers at the time of the report, not just the increase attributed to that tag.</li>
 </ul>
</div>
<h3 id="h_01HD23SMJVV5R03JC2265K8Q3K">Tag pulse</h3>
<p>The tag pulse chart shows the effectiveness of your tagged posts from a higher level. This includes the number of new followers you gained, post impressions, post engagements, and post comments you gained during the period you used that tag. This gives you a quick assessment of your tag, without having to check individual social media posts across the various social media channels.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/653037df74982009a94e765b/file-pTUOoCI4Gl.png" alt="Tag pulse - a quick snapshot of your tag performance" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<h3 id="h_01HD23SMJVBDTNBR6K5MSKXBDE">Tagged post metrics</h3>
<div>
 The tagged post metrics chart provides a more comprehensive look at your metrics so you can see a view of your metrics while using the tag on posts.
</div>
<p>Below the graph is a timeline of your tagged posts to help you visualize how each post has influenced the metrics. For example, did any post create a spike in your metrics?</p>
<div>
 Here are a few ways to use this chart:
</div>
<ul>
 <li>Click on the metrics at the top to see the respective graph.</li>
 <li>Hover over the graph to see a breakdown by channel.</li>
 <li>Click on the social icons at the top right of the chart to filter by channel.<a href="https://support.buffer.com/guide-media/01GV7PXTC3MNR28FPFGAA7G0B1">&nbsp;</a></li>
</ul>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65b92d70a7493b27a932f6ef/file-fCdGMeh221.jpg" alt="Buffer Analytics Tag metrics graph" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <div>
  Note that the metrics indicate the total number across all channels for which you've scheduled posts with tags. For example, when looking at Total Followers, the number is not the sum of total followers from the tags, but rather the cumulative total followers for your connected channels at the time of reporting.
 </div>
</div>
<p>You can also click on any of the circular icons along the post timeline below the graph to see the posts that were published that day. You’ll then see the individual metrics for that post. If multiple posts were published on the same day, you can use the arrows to scroll through each post.<a href="https://support.buffer.com/guide-media/01GV7GHQPFMT2FC1W20FHWP2Z4">&nbsp;</a></p>

<h3 id="h_01HD23SMJVXS0K3NEV02MBX236">Post insights by tag</h3>
<div>
 The tagged posts insight table will let you analyze the posts you’ve published using the relevant tag. The post with the greatest number of impressions will appear at the top of the table. If you wish, you can sort the posts by another metric. This is a great way to quickly identify your best performing post(s) using the tag.
</div>
<div>
 You can also filter the posts by certain keywords or hashtags to find specific posts.
</div>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6530387d25f843047502493a/file-aqffgS88Kk.png" alt="The tagged posts insight table will let you analyze the posts you’ve published using the relevant tag" style="width: 100%; "></p>
<h2 id="h_1229441a-7550-4c7a-b320-65325c9eafcf">Adding charts to a custom report</h2>
<div>
 Finally, you can add any of the tables and charts from your tag report to custom reports. Simply click the plus button at the top right of any chart you'd like to include. <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/534-creating-custom-analytics-reports" target="_self"><strong>Learn more about creating custom reports here</strong></a>.
</div>
<div>
 You can also export all data as both CSV and image files using the <strong><em>Export as...</em></strong> button.

<h2 id="FAQ-DNSGI">FAQ</h2>
<h3>What is the difference between "tag pulse" and "tag metrics"?</h3>
<p><b>Tag pulse</b> provides a high-level overview of a tagged campaign’s performance, summarizing key metrics like new followers gained, total impressions, engagements, and comments across all posts using that tag. It’s ideal for quickly assessing the overall impact of a campaign.</p>
<p>In contrast, <b>tag metrics</b> offer a detailed breakdown of how individual posts with the same tag performed over time. This view includes</p>
<ul>
 <li>a selectable graph for exploring specific metrics</li>
 <li>a timeline of when tagged posts were published</li>
 <li>filtering options by social channel.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s especially useful for identifying which posts or platforms contributed most to campaign results. While tag pulse is great for a snapshot, tagged post metrics allow for deeper analysis and more informed decision-making.</p>
