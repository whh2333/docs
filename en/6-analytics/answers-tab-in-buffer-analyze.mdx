<h3 id="h_01HCXQSB2F8HDKE3GNEFNRNBEA">Overview</h3>
<p>If you're looking for some quick answers about the best time to post, the best type of post and the best frequency in which to post, this chart gives you these answers at a simple glance.</p>
<p><img src="//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499638820396325b6fdc0/img-1656503-1695848801-635789863.png" alt="Answers overview showing you the best time to post, the best type of post and the best frequency to post." style="width: 100%; "></p>
<h3 id="h_01HCXQSB2FMGEVZ68F95TQJZ3T">When is the best time to post?</h3>
<p>This chart shows you your best times to post to maximize your reach. Your predicted reach for each hour is calculated using data from your previous posts and your follower‚Äôs online activity. In order to determine these times, we use the data from when your followers engaged on your past posts. For example, if you're only posting on Mondays at 8am, the best time to post would be likely show as Monday around 8am because that's probably when your followers would see and engage with your post.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Therefore, the way to ensure that Buffer is providing you with the very best information is to experiment posting on different days and at different times for a while so you can see when your followers are engaging with your posts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The three recommended times are spread throughout the week to maximize your reach for the week. You can hover over each column in the chart to see the predicted reach of that hour.</p>

 <h4 id="h_01HCXQSB2FKE984SAFC5AQCDR6">üìù Good-to-Knows</h4>
 <p><strong>We can generate the best times to post if:</strong></p>
 <ul>
  <li>The profile has at least 100 followers.</li>
  <li>We have data for at least 10 posts on the profile within the last 6 months (otherwise, we'll suggest times based on our <a href="https://buffer.com/library/when-is-the-best-time-to-post-on-instagram/">Best Times to Post on Instagram</a> research).</li>
  <li>We always take the last 100 posts into the prediction.</li>
  <li>If there are 7 days worth of data for followers of the profile (we are only able to collect follower data once a social channel is connected to Buffer and analytics is enabled).</li>
  <li><b>This chart is not available for trialists. </b></li>
  <li><strong>This chart is only available for Instagram Professional Accounts.</strong> The Best Time to Post feature is not available for Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, Google business profiles, Mastodon, Threads, Instagram Personal Accounts or YouTube Shorts.
