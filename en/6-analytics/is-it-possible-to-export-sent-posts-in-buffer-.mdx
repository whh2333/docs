        <p>Users on paid plans can export a CSV file with information from their published posts per social channel within their Analyze tab. The CSV will download as a .zip file to your computer and includes the following files:</p>
<ul>
 <li>Average performance statistics</li>
 <li>Demographic cities</li>
 <li>Demographic countries</li>
 <li>Demographic gender and age</li>
 <li>Metrics insights</li>
 <li>Performance statistics</li>
 <li>Posts</li>
 <li>Posts hashtags (when applicable)</li>
 <li>Posts summary</li>
 <li>Stories summary (when applicable)</li>
</ul>
<div class="callout-blue">
 <p>At this time, you can only export a CSV file of metrics from channels supported in Analyze, which includes Facebook Pages, Instagram business and creator accounts, LinkedIn Pages, and X/Twitter accounts.</p>
</div>
<p>To access the CSV files, navigate to&nbsp;<a href="https://analyze.buffer.com/"><em><strong>Analyze</strong></em></a>, select a social channel from the left-hand menu, select your date range, and click the&nbsp;<em><strong>"Export as..."</strong></em>&nbsp;drop-down menu to select "Export as CSV."</p>
<p>While images won't export, view the "Posts" export to find and save your previously-sent post captions.</p>
