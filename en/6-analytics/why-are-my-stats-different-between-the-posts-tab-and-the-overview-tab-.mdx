        <p>You might notice that the metrics don't always match between the <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/526-performance-overview" target="_self">Overview tab</a> and the <a href="https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/527-analyzing-your-posts-within-your-analytics-dashboard" target="_self">Posts tab</a> within the Analytics dashboard. This is because the Overview tab is measuring all of the engagement you <em>received</em> within the chosen date range, whereas the Posts tab is measuring the engagement on posts that were <em>published</em> within the chosen date range.</p>

<p>Let's say you publish a post on July 1 and it continues to get engagements into the first week of August. If youâ€™re viewing the Overview tab with a date range of August 1 - August 31, the engagements received in the first week of August, on the post you published on July 1, will be included.</p>
<p>However, if you switch over to the Posts tab and use the same date range of August 1 - August 31, you would <em>not</em> see metrics from the post you published on July 1 because this tab is only looking at posts that were <em>published</em> in August.</p>
<p>When choosing a date range, try to keep this in mind:</p>
<ul>
 <li><strong>Overview tab date range</strong>: All engagements received during this date range</li>
 <li><strong>Posts tab date range</strong>: Engagements received on posts published during this date range</li>
</ul>
