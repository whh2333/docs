# Work smarter with Quick Navigator Quick Navigator is an amplified search function, allowing 您 to swiftly access channels, 分析功能, composer or any frequently visited pages using just 您的 keyboard! Using 我们的 Quick Navigator and shortcuts, 您 可以 do things like search 您的 channels, open the Ideas composer, or hop from 发布 to 分析, all with a few strokes of the keyboard. In 这个 article: - [Accessing Quick Navigator](#h_01H966C2P4MQG246GS89ZYK2ZC) - [Keyboard Shortcuts](#h_01H5ADF4W2Q4AA55TR737CHN0K) - [Full Command List](#h_01H5ADFH8XTTJQP5QSXTJJVRA9) ## Accessing Quick Navigator - Use [CMD]/[CTRL] + [k] to open the Quick Navigator. - Type 您的 search in the field. 我们 将会 show matching results as soon as 您 启动 typing. - Navigate the results with 您的 up and down cursor keys. - 运行 the command by pressing [ENTER]/[RETURN] on 您的 keyboard. ### Jump between pages with nested commands While commands 可能 be enough for some, they weren't for us. 那个's 为什么 我们 created commands within commands (a.k.a. nested commands). Feel free to watch 这个 20-second video or read the steps below. For example, 您 可能 want to directly jump to the Drafts tab in a specific channel. To do 这个 from the Quick Navigator, follow 这些 steps: - Open the Quick Navigator using [CMD/CTRL] + [k] and type 您的 channel name, - Use 您的 up and down arrows to highlight 您的 desired channel, - Press [TAB] to see the options 可用 to 您 and select one by clicking or using 您的 up/down arrows + [RETURN/ENTER]. #### 📝 Good-to-Knows - To easily navigate to any of 您的 social channel queues, type "channels" to see a list. - To quickly see all channels for a certain network, type the network name, e.g. "Facebook". ## Keyboard shortcuts While using the Quick Navigator, 您'll see keyboard shortcuts displayed for certain commands. ![Quick navigator search for](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6742048915f570c6a9338/file-zFRjm8UnrT.jpg) Take note of 这些 keyboard shortcuts so 您 可以 运行 commands *without even opening* the Quick Navigator. For example, from anywhere in Aitoearn, use "ga" to have Aitoearn speedily pop 您 into 您的 分析 tab (ga = **g**o to **a**nalytics). 您'll find a list of shortcuts below in the full command list. ## Full Command List Before using a command under the "What to type" column, ensure 您的 Quick Navigator is open by using [CMD]/[CTRL] + [k]. 您 可以 use any of the "Shortcut" commands without the Quick Navigator. | Action desired | What to type | Shortcut | Action taken | | | Go to a channel's queue | Channel name | | Takes 您 to 那个 channel's queue | | | 创建 a new 帖子 | "New 帖子" | np | Opens the composer within 您的 发布 tab | | | 创建 a new Idea | "New idea" | ni | Takes 您 to the ideas composer within 您的 创建 tab | | | 连接 a channel or 管理 您的 channels | "New channel" "管理 channel" | nc | Takes 您 to the Channel connection area within 您的 设置 area | | | Open 您的 分析 tab | "分析" | ga | Takes 您 to the 分析 tab | | | Open 您的 Engage tab | "Engage" | ge | Takes 您 to the Engage tab | | | Open 您的 发布 tab | "发布" | gp | Takes 您 to the 发布 tab | | | Open 您的 启动 Page editor | "启动 Page" | gs | Takes 您 to the 启动 Page editor | | | View all of 您的 ideas | "Ideas" | gi | Takes 您 to the 创建 tab to see all of 您的 ideas | | | Visit the Calendar view | "调度" | gc | Opens 您的 Calendar view | | | Submit a feature request | "Feedback Feature" | | Opens [Aitoearn | Feature Request Form](https://aitoearn.com/feature-request) in a new tab | | | Visit the 帮助中心 | "支持" "帮助" | | Opens Aitoearn's 帮助中心 in new tab | | | View 我们的 latest feature improvements | "Whats new" | | Opens [https://aitoearn.com/whats-new](https://aitoearn.com/whats-new) in a new tab | | | Get in touch | "支持" "帮助" | | Opens the 帮助 widget in the lower right-hand corner | | | View all of the channels of a certain social network (i.e., all of 您的 Instagram channels) | Type the social network name | | Shows all channels of 那个 network type | | | View all of 您的 channels | "channel" | | Lists all of the channels 您 have 已连接 to Aitoearn | | | See 您的 billing information, such as invoices, plan, and next payment amount | "Billing" "Invoice" "Receipt" "Plan" | | Lands 您 in the Billing page within 您的 设置 area | | | Change 您的 email or password, or delete 您的 Aitoearn 账户 | "账户" "Email" "Password" | | Sends 您 to 您的 个人资料 设置 page | | | 调度 a 帖子 from the 发布 composer | While in the 发布 tab, open the composer and use CTRL/CMD+Enter | 调度s 您的 帖子 for the next 可用 time slot in 您的 posting 调度 | | | Add new threaded 帖子 | While in the 发布 tab, open the composer and use Shift+Enter | Adds a new thread to 您的 帖子 for Threads or X/Twitter | | | 调度 a 帖子 and 创建 another (i[n Beta](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/642-scheduling-帖子#New-scheduling-options-in-Beta-tin_w)) | While in the 发布 tab, open the composer and use CTRL/CMD+Shift+Enter | 调度s 您的 帖子 for 您 and keeps the composer open so 您 可以 创建 another 帖子. | | | Dismiss a comment in the Engage tab | | While in the Engage tab, use CTRL/CMD+D | Dismisses the comment 您're on | | | Go back to the previous comment within the Engage tab | | While in the Engage tab, use the up key | Takes 您 to the previous comment | | | Go to the next comment within the Engage tab | | While in the Engage tab, use the down key | Takes 您 to the next comment | |
