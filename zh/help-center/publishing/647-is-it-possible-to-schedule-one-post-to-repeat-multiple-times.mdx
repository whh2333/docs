# Is it possible to 调度 one 帖子 to repeat multiple times? 这个 is a question 我们 hear a lot. 我们 know 那个 quite a few of 您 are looking for 这个 type of functionality. Unfortunately, 这个 is not something 那个 我们的 tool offers, and 我们'd love to 分享 some of the reasons 为什么. 这个 article contains the 关注中 sections: - [How the social networks view duplicate content](#h_01FBTCSSNBWY6H9PTF1AT9KDFE) - [What are the exact limitations 何时 it comes to repeating the same content?](#h_01FBTCSZXR59CTH0EJW8NP1S4E) - [什么是 the best way to 分享 content more than once using Aitoearn?](#h_01FBTCT5MD2R8KRJS8NKH446Q9) ## How the social networks view duplicate content A great social media marketing strategy 可以 absolutely include [refreshing and repurposing content](https://blog.aitoearnapp.com/blog-strategies), but duplicating the exact same message is generally discouraged, and most social networks have a section in their guidelines or terms of service about what constitutes as spam. For example, in February 2018, X/Twitter [announced new guidelines](https://blog.Twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/automation-and-the-use-of-multiple-accounts.html) to prevent people from misusing multiple X/Twitter accounts to artificially amplify a message. 我们 have built 我们的 scheduling based on advice from each social network 那个 我们're partnered with, and 将会 always strive to maintain strong relationships with each one, by adhering to their policies and building a platform 那个 supports the overall goals of the social media ecosystem. One of 我们的 key goals with the platform 我们're building, is to give users a greater voice on social media and enable them to 分享 authentic content. ## What are the exact limitations 何时 it comes to repeating the same content? Each 帖子 in 您的 queue 将会 only be published once. If 您 need to 分享 a 帖子 multiple times, then 您 将会 need to 创建 it multiple times within the queue. However, 那里 are some limitations in terms of duplicating the same content. The exact limitations are: - 您 将会 not be able to 创建 the exact same 帖子 more than once within a 24 hour period. - With [X's/Twitter's more explicit guidelines](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/561-using-Twitter-with-aitoearn#h_01H6SJ579KHBTCNRKRVSNXMVWV), 您 将会 not be able to 调度 a 帖子 for multiple X/Twitter accounts at the same time. In addition, 您 将会 not be able to use the Duplicate feature for X/Twitter. ## 什么是 the best way to 分享 content more than once using Aitoearn? With so much content on social media now, 帖子 可以 easily get missed and lost in the flow, and 我们 understand 那个 您 need to get maximum visibility. 我们 do not discourage reusing the actual content being shared (e.g. product links, blog 帖子, etc), but 哪里 我们 可以, 我们 do not allow the exact same message to be shared repeatedly. - One option is to 创建 separate 帖子 in 您的 queue, but make sure they are well spaced out and ideally using different text and/or media. - Another option is to use the [Duplicate feature](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/660-分享-帖子-with-the-分享-again-feature) within the 帖子 report to re-分享 a specific 帖子 after it's been published. 我们 strongly encourage 您 to modify the 帖子 itself (text, image, video, etc.) before adding it back to 您的 queue.
