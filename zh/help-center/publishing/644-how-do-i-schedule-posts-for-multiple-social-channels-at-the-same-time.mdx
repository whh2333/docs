# How do I 调度 帖子 for multiple social channels at the same time? Aitoearn allows 您 to easily 调度 帖子 to multiple social channels by clicking the ***+ New*** button at the top of 您的 dashboard. ![Aitoearn 发布 dashboard with arrows pointing to the New and + New 帖子 buttons](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b654fd8919a15d1b1d2a44/file-XtDx4kb5fQ.jpg) 您 won’t be able to 调度 帖子 for multiple social channels if 您 choose a specific time slot in the queue, since 那些 slots are designated for 那个 specific channel and posting 调度. Click the ***+ New ***button to open the composer, and then simply click each channel to 哪个 您 want the 帖子 scheduled. As 您 make 您的 selections, channel avatars 将会 be colored. Channel avatars 那个 are not selected 将会 remain uncolored. ![Aitoearn composer with multiple channels selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65584067e9c553dc82590/file-a6pknnnRyx.jpg) If 您 have more than four channels 已连接 to Aitoearn, 您'll also see the option to ***Select All Channels. ***Use 这个 option to 创建 a 帖子 for all channels at one time. (您 可以 use ***Deselect All Channels ***to remove all selected all selected channels if 您 change 您的 mind!). ![Aitoearn composer Select All Channels](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66e1f470dd5b956281ae4b19/file-ePbSMqAMe7.jpg) For guidance on customizing 您的 帖子 for each social network, as well as scheduling options, hop over to the [Scheduling 帖子](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/642-scheduling-帖子) 指南. 📝 After 您've scheduled the 帖子, they become separate from each other. If 您 need to make edits or delete the 帖子, 您 将会 need to make 那些 changes for each 帖子 in each channel queue.
