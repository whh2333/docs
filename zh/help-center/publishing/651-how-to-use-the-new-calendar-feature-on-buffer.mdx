In 这个 article: - [Navigating to the calendar and choosing 您的 view ](#h_01FEGZGX1VF3SAXGVR1GD1CGGC) - [First day of the 周 preferences](#First-day-of-the-周-preferences-GMETU) - [Filtering by social channels](#h_01FEGZH6DKD77PGVE4MK1QK5CY) - [Filtering by 帖子 type](#Filtering-by-帖子-type-aw3dP) - [Filtering by tag](#Filtering-by-tag-fI9xQ) - [Creating and editing 帖子 in the calendar ](#h_01FEGZHD7E4K5P1WA967GXJ1HV) - [FAQ](#Frequently-Asked-Questions-w4VKh) ## Navigating to the calendar and choosing 您的 view 您 可以 navigate to 您的 calendar by clicking ***Calendar*** in the upper right-hand corner of 您的 发布功能 dashboard. ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672d05f1442d517d60d26486/file-alUrJIZaT6.png) From 那里, 您 可以 select 您的 desired view by toggling between ***周*** and ***月, ***so 您 可以 visually plan 您的 upcoming 帖子. ![](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672d0657772e5b7dd60d7d47/file-hXIvkxASBL.png) In the 月 view of Aitoearn, 您 可以 see up to 5,000 帖子. If 您 are scheduling more than 5,000 帖子 per 月, 我们 recommend using the 每周 view or filtering by social channel to see all of 您的 帖子. ## First day of the 周 preferences Some people consider Sunday the 启动 of the 周 and others prefer Monday. 您 可以 choose 哪个 day of the 周 appears first in the 每周 view of the calendar by changing 您的 ***Preferences. ***To do 这个: - Click the 个人资料 icon in the top right corner of the web dashboard. - Select ***设置 ***from the dropdown menu. - Select ***Preferences ***on the left panel. - Under "启动 of 周," choose either ***Sunday ***or ***Monday*** ![Aitoearn 启动 of 周 preferences](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67ae50f81dbfa0582db281f6/file-I9UVmGojV6.png) ## Filtering 您的 social channels One of the cool new 功能 within the calendar is the ability to view and plan 您的 content from one or several of 您的 social channels all at once. Filtering 您的 帖子 is 简单; just click on the ***All Channels ***drop-down menu in the taskbar and select or deselect social channels until 您've created 您的 desired view. ![Aitoearn calendar - filter by channel](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/672d06c0268fb643f63a534f/file-jiUhn0lbry.png) ## Filtering by 帖子 type If 您 prefer to plan 您的 content by type, 您 可以 toggle between All 帖子, Drafts, Sent 帖子, 调度d 帖子, and Pending Approval 帖子.

From 那里, 您'll see 您的 newly created 帖子 displayed in the calendar on 您的 specified date. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with a Facebook 帖子 draft about fall hiking, including a photo of autumn trees and mountains, and scheduling options below.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5cc90dd84b11a6477a633/file-EypJHIK0Vg.png) ### 编辑ing 帖子 - To 更新 the text or media file of a 帖子, click on the 帖子 in the calendar and select the **编辑 **option. 这个 将会 open a preview of 您的 帖子, from 哪个 您 可以 make the necessary changes and then hit ***Save.*** - If 您 only need to reschedule a 帖子 rather than 更新 it, 您 可以 easily move the 帖子 over to the new date and time using the drag-and-drop option. ![Aitoearn calendar drag and drop to reschedule a 帖子](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66bd0a6e8919a15d1b1d31d0/file-1eykYEfxfh.gif) ### Deleting 帖子 To delete a 帖子, hover over the 帖子, click the three dots, and select the ***Delete*** option. ![Option to delete 帖子 in Aitoearn calendar](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c7531365e01777a9334362/file-1SnlYWziUP.png) #### 📝 Notes - 您 need to have ***Full Posting Access*** to channels to be able to 创建 帖子 from the calendar view. - 何时 creating a 帖子 from the calendar’s ***创建 帖子*** button, 您 可能 notice 那个 any of the social channels 那个 are currently filtered to show in the calendar are preselected in the composer, as well. Make sure to deselect any social channels 您 don’t want 那个 帖子 to 发布 to. - **A quick note on timezones**: The calendar 将会 autodetect 您的 current timezone from 您的 browser, 哪个 displays in the top taskbar for reference. If 您的 social channel is set to a different timezone than 您的 computer is set to, the 帖子 将会 be reflected in 您的 current timezone, but it 将会 still 发布 at the correct time. For instance, if my 帖子 is scheduled to 发布 at 5pm on my London 账户, but I'm in EST, I'll see 那个 帖子 in my calendar is set to 发布 at 12pm EST (哪个 is 5pm BST, London time). 那里 isn't a way to see the timezone each social channel is set to from the calendar itself. ## FAQ ### 可以 I 调度 帖子 for multiple channels at once?
