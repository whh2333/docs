# 每日 posting limits Each social network has their own guidelines on how much content to 帖子. For example, Facebook recommends up to five 帖子 per day, but 35 is really the upper limit they allow without negatively impacting the 触达 of 您的 帖子. The posting limits 我们 have implemented, in accordance with each social network's guidelines, are shown in the table below. 这些 limits *don't* affect the [number of 帖子 您 可以 store in 您的 queue](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/643-how-many-帖子-可以-i-调度-in-advance) at any one time. | **Social network** | **帖子 per 24 hours** | | | Facebook | 35 | | | Instagram | 50* | | | X/Twitter | 100 | | | LinkedIn | 50 | | | Pinterest | 25 for customers who verify their email on Aitoearn; 5 for customers who have not verified their email | | | TikTok | 25 | | | Google | 50 | | | 启动 Page | Unlimited | | | YouTube Shorts | 10 for unverified users.
