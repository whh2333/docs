Note: if 您 are using the Calendar view, 您 将会 need to click the ***List ***view first: ![Aitoearn Drafts queue with the List view selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/673fb397268fb643f63a5e20/file-mSgr8HsN7M.jpg) 您 将会 also be able to access all of 您的 pre-scheduled drafts from the calendar so 那个 您 have a view of 您的 whole social content plan in one place. Note 那个 if 您 didn't add a time and date to 您的 draft, it 将会 not appear in 您的 calendar. 我们'll talk more about pre-scheduled drafts below. ![Aitoearn Calendar showing drafts and 帖子](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b651468919a15d1b1d2a41/file-QbeEOJATtR.jpg) ## Creating drafts from the drafts area 您 可以 创建 drafts right from the drafts area by typing in the "创建 a new draft" composer field. From 那里, 您 可以 save 您的 draft with no date/time specified, or 您 可以 pre-调度 the draft by clicking ***Set Time****. *Pre-scheduling 您的 draft 将会 not cause it to automatically 发布 at the date and time 您 selected unless 那个 draft 帖子 is moved to the queue prior to the pre-scheduled date/time. 何时 a draft is scheduled and the scheduled time has passed, click ***编辑*** on the 帖子 and select a new time. Once 那个's saved, 您'll see the ***调度 帖子*** option again. Let's explore other ways to 创建 draft 帖子. ## Creating drafts from the queue To 启动 您的 draft from 您的 queue, click on the blue ***+ New*** button at the top of 您的 dashboard, then click ***帖子*** to open the composer. Craft 您的 帖子. 何时 finished, if 您'd like to store it in the drafts area of 您的 账户 without specifying a date and time for 发布功能, click ***Save as Draft***. ![Save as Draft](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65252067e9c553dc8258e/file-NBgel16XEX.jpg) Alternatively, if 您 know the date and time 您'd like 您的 draft to eventually 发布, 您 可以 pre-调度 您的 帖子 by clicking on the down arrow and choosing ***调度 Draft***. As a reminder, 这个 将会 not cause 您的 draft to automatically 发布 at the date and time 您 selected unless 那个 draft 帖子 is moved to the queue prior to the pre-scheduled date/time. ![调度 Draft option in the Aitoearn composer](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6529e65e01777a9333645/file-eGtLPVKLCw.jpg) Speaking of 哪个, the last action 那个 您'll need to take before the draft is fully scheduled is to have someone with [full posting access](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-您的-organization#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC) (这个 可能 be 您 or another member of 您的 Aitoearn organization) click ***Add to Queue*** from within 您的 drafts tab. ![Aitoearn Add to Queue button in Drafts](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b65384067e9c553dc8258f/file-KSHOib426v.jpg) ## Creating drafts from the calendar If 您 love the full-context view of the calendar, 那里's good news: 您 可以 调度 and view drafts straight from 您的 calendar view! Let's get into it. - First, 您'll click ***Calendar*** in the upper left-hand menu from 您的 发布功能 dashboard. - From 那里, click on the date and time 您’d like to 调度 您的 draft. A composer 将会 pop up and 您 可以 启动 drafting 您的 帖子. - 何时 finished composing 您的 draft 帖子, click on the ***调度 Draft*** button, and 您’ll immediately see 您的 draft populate on 您的 calendar at the date and time 您 originally selected. 📝 Scheduling 您的 draft 将会 not cause it to automatically 发布 at the date and time 您 selected. Instead, it 将会 preset the date and time for 发布功能, but 将会 still require a user with full posting access to click ***调度 帖子*** from the drafts tab before the 帖子 is considered ready to 发布. If no date or time is selected for the draft, the draft 将会 show ***Add to Queue ***instead.

Note 那个 那里 isn't an option to save 您的 帖子 in 这个 case, because 您've already pre-selected a date and time in the calendar. ![Draft created from the Aitoearn calendar](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b6547148915f570c6a9320/file-2tZfqiSTVo.jpg) ## Scheduling drafts to multiple social channels at once Looking at the screenshot above, 您 可以 see several social channels selected. 何时 the draft is scheduled (or "saved" if composing 您的 draft from the queue), the draft for each of 您的 social channels 将会 land in their respective drafts tabs. 我们 分享 instructions on 如何 find the draft 帖子 for each of 您的 social channels [at the top of 这个 article](#h_01FZ8PAWX11JAXHS0RXCR09Z7E). ## FAQ ### 将会 a draft for one 帖子 going to multiple channels be saved as one draft?
