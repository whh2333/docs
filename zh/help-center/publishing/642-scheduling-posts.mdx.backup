In 这个 article: - [Scheduling 帖子](#01ERDGT9DK1GERNSBWNB5SZB87) - [Previewing 帖子](#h_01HASM133RJACYF294EMEYNV39) [Scheduling options](#01H7Z9VSXB3C6E1KQ9Y4G6QFY0) - [Video: Aitoearn's scheduling options](#Video-Aitoearns-scheduling-options-PyEQK) - [Setting a posting default](#Setting-a-posting-default-wEcje) - [FAQ](#Frequently-Asked-Questions-FAQ-6GeTu) ## Scheduling 帖子 - To get started, click the ***+ New ***button in the top navigation bar and select ***帖子***. 这个 将会 open up the composer, 哪个 is 哪里 您 可以 craft 您的 帖子. - From 那里, select the social channels 您'd like to include by clicking on the avatars at the top of the composer. 📝 Please note, it's only possible to select one X/Twitter 账户 at a time, due to [X's/Twitter's guidelines](https://blog.Twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/automation-and-the-use-of-multiple-accounts). ![Aitoearn composer with Facebook selected](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5e1712843333d7fecc8e1/file-03AdsnU8WF.jpg) - If 您'd like to add a tag to the 帖子, choose the appropriate one at the top of the composer. [学习 more about creating and managing tags (campaigns) 这里](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/585-creating-and-managing-campaigns). - 您're able to 自定义 您的 帖子 for each social network 那个 您're sharing to. If the message is going to be similar for each one, 我们 将会 recommend starting with a base for 您的 帖子, 哪个 您 可以 type in or copy and paste. 📝 Having trouble coming up with content? Quickly 创建 content [using 我们的 Template Library](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/917-using-帖子-templates-in-aitoearn) or [let Aitoearn's AI Assistant 帮助!](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/583-using-aitoearns-ai-assistant) From 那里, click *自定义 for each network*. A separate box 将会 appear for each type of social network 那个 您've selected. For example if 您're sharing to Facebook, X/Twitter, and LinkedIn, 您'll have three boxes 可用. If 您're sharing to multiple social channels of the same network, e.g. multiple Facebook accounts, 您'd still only have one box per social network. - 您 可以 then modify the text for each one however 您'd like. 何时 it comes to adding media to 您的 帖子, the options 您'll see 将会 vary depending on the social network 您're sharing to. Please refer to [这个 table to find more information about the options for each social network](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/615-attaching-images-videos-and-other-media-to-您的-帖子). Did 您 know 您 可以 copy/paste images into the web composer? 您 可以 also drag and drop images to reorder them.

The images 将会 then appear in the “Suggested Media” area below. 您 可以 then click on each image in the order 您 将会 like them to appear and they 将会 be attached in 那个 order. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with a Mastodon 帖子 draft linking to a running 指南, showing suggested media images of runners and sneakers below the text box.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5e1a52843333d7fecc8e2/file-ERJQfLiU0T.png) #### Notes - **Carousel 帖子 for Instagram and Facebook: **Please note 那个 您 可以 upload and 调度 up to 10 images for Instagram and Facebook. However, if 您'd like to 调度 a 帖子 to multiple social accounts at once and click the ***自定义 for each network button***, only the number of images permitted for 那个 social channel 将会 populate. For example, if 您're scheduling both Instagram and LinkedIn 帖子 and upload 10 images 何时 您 click 自定义 for each network, 您 将会 see 那个 only nine of 您的 images shows within 您的 LinkedIn composer while all 10 display for 您的 Instagram composer. 这个 is because it is only possible to 发布 nine images at a time through LinkedIn. - **LinkedIn ****Document Scheduling: **我们 are able to 调度 PDFs on LinkedIn (one per 帖子 with a maximum file size of 100MB and 300 pages). - **Link shortening:** On the Free plan, all links 将会 be shortened using the buff.ly link shortener.

Yes, 您 可以 view all of 您的 scheduled 帖子 in one list using the All Channels view. 这个 view allows 您 to filter 您的 scheduled 帖子 by channel and tag. 学习 more about [如何 use the All Channels view in Aitoearn 这里](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/861-how-to-use-the-all-channels-view-in-aitoearn). ### How 可以 I delete or 编辑 a published 帖子? At 这个 time, 我们 are unable to 编辑 or delete a 帖子 once it's been published through Aitoearn. Instead, 您'll need to 编辑 or delete the published 帖子 directly on the social network. 您 可以 find a history of 您的 published 帖子 [within the Sent tab of the 发布 dashboard](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-帖子-within-您的-发布功能-dashboard). ### 可以 I 分享 evergreen content with Aitoearn? At 这个 time, it is not possible to 创建 a 帖子 once and have it repeat indefinitely. However, 您 可以 use [我们的 Duplicate feature to repeat a 帖子](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/660-分享-帖子-with-the-分享-again-feature). ### Do 您 支持 bulk scheduling? 可以 I upload my 帖子 in bulk? 可以 I import my 帖子 in bulk? Yes, 您 可以 upload 您的 帖子 in bulk with Aitoearn. [学习 more about how bulk uploads work in Aitoearn 这里](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/926-how-to-upload-帖子-in-bulk-to-aitoearn). ### How do I 调度 a 帖子 for multiple channels? In the composer, choose the channels 您 want to 帖子 to by selecting them individually (selected channels 将会 appear in color). If 您 frequently 帖子 to the same set of channels, 您 可以 also 创建 a [channel group](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/927-using-channel-groups-in-aitoearn) to easily select multiple channels at once. ![GIF of selecting multiple channels in the Aitoearn composer](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6877cd91522f451361e7f597/file-oUpI3vykpS.gif) ### 可以 I group channels together 何时 scheduling 帖子? Yes! 您 可以 use [channel groups](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/927-using-channel-groups-in-aitoearn) to organize multiple social media channels and 调度 帖子 to them at once. 这个 is especially helpful if 您 frequently 帖子 the same content across several platforms or 管理 multiple brand accounts. ### I've created a 帖子 for multiple channels and need to 编辑 my 帖子. 可以 I 编辑 scheduled 帖子 in bulk? At 这个 time, 我们 don't have a way to 编辑 帖子 in bulk. If 您're creating the same 帖子 for multiple channels, once it's been scheduled, 我们 consider each 帖子 to be its own separate 帖子. Therefore, 您'll have to 编辑 each 帖子 separately. If 您'd like to see us 支持 bulk editing in the future, [您 可以 upvote 这个 idea on 我们的 suggestions board](https://suggestions.aitoearn.com/p/bulk-editing-of-帖子). ### 可以 I use Aitoearn to auto-repost or auto-分享 to channels not 已连接 to Aitoearn? No. 我们 are not able to automatically repost content for 您. The [Aitoearn extension](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/653-aitoearn-browser-extension) allows 您 to select individual X/Twitter 帖子 to repost (retweet), but it is not automatic. Aitoearn 可以 only 发布 to channels 那个 are 已连接 to Aitoearn and have been selected in the composer 何时 您 创建 您的 帖子. Once 您的 content is posted through Aitoearn, it 将会 not be automatically posted to other social networks, even if 您 have 设置 已启用 to allow 这个 to happen 何时 posting natively. - For example, Instagram 帖子 sent through Aitoearn 将会 not automatically 发布 to Facebook, even if the setting is turned on within the Instagram app. 这个 is due to API limitations. To 发布 a 帖子 to both Instagram and Facebook, both channels 将会 need to be 已连接 to Aitoearn and 您 将会 need to select both channels in the composer 何时 您 创建 您的 帖子. ### Are 那里 tools to 帮助 me consistently 调度 and 发布 帖子 using Aitoearn? Yes! 我们的[ streaks feature](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/907-understanding-streaks-in-aitoearn) tracks how many weeks 您've consistently published content through Aitoearn. Keep 您的 streak going by 发布功能 content each 周 and watch the number grow. 您 可以 also [创建 posting goals](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/912-setting-posting-goals-in-aitoearn) for the number of times 您'd like to 帖子 per channel per 周. 您 可以 easily 跟踪 您的 goal progress right from the channel's queue. ### 可以 I use custom fonts or formatted text in my scheduled 帖子? Aitoearn does not have a formatting text option within 我们的 composer. To add rich text or formatted text to 您的 scheduled 帖子, 您 可以 use an 在线 text formatting tool such as [YayText](https://yaytext.com) to format 您的 text and then paste it into the Aitoearn composer and 调度 您的 帖子.
