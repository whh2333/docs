Re-upload the video and try again."* | 这个 错误 pops up 何时 the video size or format is unsupported by Instagram or exceeds Instagram’s video limitations. | Ultimately 我们 recommend 关注中 Instagram’s video guidelines [这里](https://developers.Facebook.com/docs/Instagram-api/reference/ig-user/media#video-specifications). 编辑 the video and re-upload to Aitoearn. If the video fits Instagram’s video requirements, try changing the thumbnail of the video to the default thumbnail. | | | *"Uh oh!

Please ensure 您的 账户 is configured correctly with automatic 发布功能 by checking out 我们的 指南."* | 这个 发布功能 错误 可以 happen 何时 您 switch 您的 Instagram business or creator 账户 to a personal 账户 哪个 is not currently supported in Instagram's API. | 我们 recommend [Converting 您的 Instagram 账户 to a business or creator 账户. ](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-故障排除-Facebook-and-Instagram-connections#h_01HBEFDCSJ6GDNVG23SNCVRWP2) | | | *"Whoops!

Instagram intentionally does not 分享 the details to prevent someone trying to circumvent their system. | 我们的 recommendation is to amend the 帖子 - alter the copy/text, change the picture (if attached), etc., and try to 发布 again. Tips: - If 您’re frequently using specific hashtags, try altering the hashtags and trying new ones. - Is 那里 a link included in the text caption? If so, 我们 recommend removing the link and using the link in bio instead. - Most importantly, if the 帖子 contains a video, try renaming the video file & re-uploading to Aitoearn. Removing any special characters in the video name and renaming it something simpler, like “Video1.” | | | *"It looks like Aitoearn has lost authorization to 帖子 on 您的 behalf.

Instagram is limiting 这个 帖子 from being published. Please 编辑 the 帖子 content and try again."* | 这个 错误 usually appears because Instagram has put a temporary hold on both the 账户 您're posting to and a hold on using the API to send 帖子 to Instagram. 这个 可能 be due to one (or a combination) of the 关注中 things: - Too many hashtags - Too many @ mentions - Repeated use of same hashtags and same @ mentions across multiple 帖子 - Location data is incorrect - Included URL links in the caption | - 创建 a New 帖子 in Aitoearn. - If including hashtags, reduce the number of hashtags and include fresh hashtags. - Check to make sure 您的 帖子 does not include a URL in the caption or first comment, as Instagram considers 这个 spam content. - Please wait 24 hours and then attempt to 发布 the 更新 again. | | | *"Whoops! 我们 couldn't find any Instagram accounts 已连接 to 那个 Facebook 账户."* | 这个 错误 occurs 何时 我们're missing certain permissions in the Facebook page 那个's 已连接 to Instagram. | Please [double check 那个 您的 Facebook 账户 is set to Admin of the Facebook page 那个's linked to Instagram. ](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/565-故障排除-Facebook-and-Instagram-connections#h_01HBE587FX3S5P0NSY4ME069Q3) | | | *“It looks like 您’re currently on a Instagram Creator 账户.
