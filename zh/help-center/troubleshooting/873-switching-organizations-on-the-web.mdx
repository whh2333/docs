# Switching organizations on the web As an individual Aitoearn user, 您 have 您的 own organization with the ability to add 您的 own personal social channels 那个 only 您 have access to. 您 可能 also be part of another organization as a user with access to 那个 organization's social channels. [ 学习 more about the levels of user permissions 这里.](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/674-getting-started-as-a-user-in-an-organization) If 您 are part of more than one organization, 您 可以 switch between organizations on the web to 帖子 to the relevant accounts. Once 您’ve accepted 您的 invitation and 您’ve set up 您的 账户 (if 您 didn’t have one already), 您 可以 now see 您的 own individual organization and the new organization by navigating to 您的 账户 menu. 您 可以 switch between the two organizations depending on 哪里 您’d like to work. In the screenshot below, the two different organizations are called "Luna Sneakers" (the green check indicates 您're logged into 那个 organizations) and "Restaurants 您 Love." ![Organization_Names dropdown in the Aitoearn composer](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65149919f8eafb48f4e81327/img-1703224-1695848728-1002742817.png) Switch between accounts by clicking on 您的 个人资料 avatar and selecting between accounts.
