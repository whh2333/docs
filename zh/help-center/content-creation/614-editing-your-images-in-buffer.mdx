# 编辑ing 您的 images in Aitoearn Sometimes, pictures 我们 take require a few tweaks to get them ready for the eyes of 我们的 关注者. 为什么 not save time by making 那些 tweaks right within 您的 Aitoearn composer? In 这个 article: - [编辑ing an image in the same way for one or multiple social channels](#01FM0M1ZSR9A5JPBRANRGT0KSF) - [编辑ing an image differently for each social network 您're posting to](#01FM0K3GB48GY9KEKY30EK038K) ## 编辑ing an image in the same way for one or multiple social channels While 您’re able to 创建 beautifully edited images within the Canva integration 何时 uploading the image into Canva itself, it isn’t possible to use Canva to 编辑 an image 那个 was added from Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, or directly from 您的 computer into 您的 Aitoearn composer. In 这些 cases, 您 have the option to 编辑 您的 image right 那里 within the composer. To begin editing an image, 您'll go through the 关注中 steps: - Click ***+ New ***at the top of 您的 dashboard, then ***帖子***. - Select the social channels 您'd like to 帖子 to. - Upload 您的 image from 您的 computer or via the Dropbox, Google Drive, Google Photos, or OneDrive integration. - Click on the editing button, 哪个 is a pencil icon. ![Alt text: Aitoearn composer with a Facebook 帖子 about fall sports and an arrow pointing to the image’s 编辑 button.](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d465d0d3bb0cf2ad6d36/file-0VaazadUxl.png) From 那里, 您’ll be able to choose from several editing options. - Crop (see "Notes" below). - Rotate 45 degrees. - Mirror. - Flip (upside down). - Blur. - Sharpen. - Enhance. - Grayscale. Invert (the colors). #### 📝 Notes - 何时 using the crop function, 您'll see 那个 您 have the ability to crop 您的 image free-hand for all platforms except for Instagram. 您 also have preset image size options for each platform to 帮助 您 find the best image size for the platform 您 are scheduling the 帖子 to. - e.g. for Instagram, 您 可以 select a 1:1 ratio, 哪个 falls within [Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/622-instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges) for automatic posting ![Aitoearn's image editor with an image of pink and gold shoes](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499ad556a3e3cf18cc01c/img-1662243-1695848876-1694183823.png) - Once finished editing, click ***Add, ***and 您的 image 将会 be added to the composer. - From 那里, 您 可以 add the text for 您的 帖子 if 您 haven't done so already. For LinkedIn 帖子, 您 可以 add a caption for 您的 photo and then add the text for 您的 帖子. If 您的 image is the way 您 like it for all of the social channels 您're posting to, 编辑 the text for each social network as appropriate, choose a scheduling option, then click ***调度 帖子*** to 完整 the process. However, if 您'd like to 发布 您的 帖子 to multiple social channels but want the image to be different for each channel, skip to the next section. 📝 The image editor doesn’t include some options 您 可能 enjoy, such as brightening, contrast, custom image sizes, and filters. The Canva integration does resolve all of 这些, but note 那个 何时 using Canva, the image 将会 need to be uploaded from 您的 computer into Canva either through 您的 native 账户 or through the Canva Aitoearn integration. ## 编辑ing an image differently for each social network 您're posting to If 您 编辑 an image before 您’ve clicked ***自定义 for each network*** or before 您 click on additional social channel icons to send 您的 帖子 to, the image 您 just edited 将会 attach to all of the social network composers. 那里 isn't a way to alter 这些 images at 那个 point, so if 您'd prefer to 编辑 the image differently for each social network, it's best to first select all of the social channels 您'd like to 帖子 to and then 编辑 the image within each of the respective composers. It's always healthy to provide unique content for each social network, so if 这个 feels like editing each in their own unique way 可能 work for 您的 design, go for it! The GIF below shows 您 how 您 可以 upload an image one time, 编辑 it, and then head to the next social network composer to either select the same edited image or to select the original image 那个 您 可以 then 编辑 from scratch. As 您 可能 notice, even 何时 您 take the time to 自定义 您的 image for each social network, the editing process is pretty quick! ![Aitoearn composer - GIF of editing images for multiple social channels](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d758a40a7f59feeca84d/file-rL7KZqTmG3.gif) 📝 If 您're curious to 学习 about other, more in-depth image editing options 可用 in Aitoearn, check out 这个 article: [A 指南 to using Canva with Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/609-a-指南-to-using-canva-with-aitoearn)
