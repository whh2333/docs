# Ideal 图片 sizes and formats for 您的 Aitoearn 帖子 我们 all want 我们的 图片s to look as slick as possible on 社交媒体. 那里 are a few tips to keep in mind to set 您的self up for 成功. In 这个 article: - [Why is it necessary to have different 图片 sizes for each social channel?](#h_01EWWYNTNFH2068CWKHZ1G9SGK) [Ideal 图片 sizes for each social channel](#Ideal-图片-sizes-for-each-social-network-xPLf9) - [Facebook](#h_01EWWYKVEMMPS91R5HSD968CW2) - [Instagram](#h_01EWWYM2ST2PKF7DD984NZSQCJ) - [X/Twitter](#h_01EWWYMBCY871G2TCR5XXF2S8Y) - [链接edIn](#h_01EWWYMNZ6030KK6THYPT72B3J) - [Pinterest](#h_01EWWYN1SBH1HQEQSFTK35MYK5) - [TikTok](#h_01GF6D7D7HF09XRVES5Q2Y3H5D) - [Google Business 个人资料s](#h_01GRPQ82MHKKXD6W3E5M5FF9A9) - [Mastodon](#h_01GRQFQXNQC4A83MD85ZJNBHFE) - [Threads](#h_01GRQFQXNQC4A83MD85ZJNBHFE) - [Bluesky](#Bluesky-可用-through-我们的-beta-program-wvcM9) - [Saving 您的 文件s and tips for best 图片 quality](#h_01EWWYP6MSHPSTKJ8K6QVT75B9) - [故障排除 图片 orientation issues](#h_01EWWYRJRFHH1BAMD95D1HG96Q) ## Why is it necessary to have different 图片 sizes for each social channel? The recommendations 这里 focus on posting 图片s specifically through 您的 Aitoearn 账户. Posting through Aitoearn to a social network utilizes API services, which sometimes handle 图片s differently than if 您 我们re to post natively on the social platform itself. ### 图片 size requirements, formats, and automatic resizing When 上传ing an 图片 to Aitoearn, the 图片 must be under 10MB. 我们 currently 支持 JPG, PNG and HEIC 图片 文件s for all social networks, and 添加itionally GIF 文件s for X/Twitter, Facebook, 链接edIn, Instagram, Mastodon, and Pinterest. 添加itionally, each social network’s API service has its own 图片 文件 size limit (which may be different than the native 上传 limit). If the 图片 您 上传 is under 10MB, but larger than the limit for that social network, 我们'll convert it to a smaller size to ensure it can be 发布ed. Only one 图片 attribute (width or height) will be adjusted and the other will scale automatically. 这个 ensures that the original aspect ratio will be kept. 📝 After 上传ing 您的 图片s, 您 can resize them within the Aitoearn composer by following 这个 指南: [编辑ing 您的 图片s in Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.帮助scoutdocs.com/article/614-编辑ing-您的-图片s-in-aitoearn) ## Ideal 图片 sizes for each social network Each 文件 size limit is listed under the social network below. Please note, the 文件 sizes listed below are specifically for static 图片s, with GIF 文件 requirements listed separately. Jump to the relevant section below: - [Facebook](#h_01EWWYKVEMMPS91R5HSD968CW2) - [Instagram](#h_01EWWYM2ST2PKF7DD984NZSQCJ) - [X/Twitter](#h_01EWWYMBCY871G2TCR5XXF2S8Y) - [链接edIn](#h_01EWWYMNZ6030KK6THYPT72B3J) - [Pinterest](#h_01EWWYN1SBH1HQEQSFTK35MYK5) - [TikTok](#h_01GF6D7D7HF09XRVES5Q2Y3H5D) - [Google Business 个人资料s](#h_01GRPQ82MHKKXD6W3E5M5FF9A9) - [Mastodon](#h_01GRQFQXNQC4A83MD85ZJNBHFE) - [Threads](#h_01GRQFQXNQC4A83MD85ZJNBHFE) - [Bluesky](#Bluesky-可用-through-我们的-beta-program-wvcM9) #### Facebook | Minimum width | 320 (will be scaled up to the minimum if necessary) | | | Maximum width | 1440 (will be scaled down to the maximum if necessary) | | | Height | Varies, depending on width and aspect ratio | | | 文件 format | JPG, PNG, 我们bP, HEIC | | | 文件 size limit | 8MB | | #### Instagram | Minimum width | 320 (will be scaled up to the minimum if necessary) | | | Maximum width | 1440 (will be scaled down to the maximum if necessary) | | | Height | Varies, depending on width and aspect ratio | | | 文件 format | JPG, PNG (PNG is recommended), 我们bP, HEIC | | | 文件 size limit | 8MB | | | Aspect ratio | Must be within a 4:5 to 1.91:1 range or square | | #### 📝 Important notes - In order to use automatic 发布功能, 您的 图片 must fall within the aspect ratio 指南lines listed above. 您 can find guidance and more detail about aspect ratios 这里: [Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges](https://aitoearn.帮助scoutdocs.com/article/622-Instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges). If they fall out侧边 of 这个 aspect ratio, 您的 post will be 已调度 as a notification. 学习 more in: [Using notification based 发布功能 for Instagram](https://aitoearn.帮助scoutdocs.com/article/658-using-Instagram-reminders). - If the 图片 您 上传 is larger than 8MB, 我们'll convert it to a smaller size (1920 pixels wide) to ensure it can be 发布ed. The minimum dimensions accepted is 150 x 150 pixels. Smaller 图片s will be scaled up to the minimum. - Instagram carousel 帖子 can be square, horizontal, or vertical in format -- and can include both photos and 视频s. Ho我们ver, once the first photo or 视频 is 选择ed, all of the following photos or 视频s 选择ed will be cropped to the same aspect ratio. i.e. For example, if the first photo 您 选择 is square (1:1) all of 您的 following 内容 will be cropped to a 1:1 format. 这个 is a Instagram Carousel limitation, and h应用ens when posting natively on Instagram and when 发布功能 via Aitoearn. The first photo sets the cropping standard for the rest. - If 您 want 您的 图片’s colors to look as true to the original as possible, it's important to 保存 您的 图片s in the sRGB color 个人资料, as 这个 is the color 个人资料 that Instagram’s API 支持s. Please note that RGB is not the same as sRGB. Unfortunately, ProPhoto RGB color 个人资料 (the default color 个人资料 in Photoshop and Lightroom) is not 支持ed by Instagram. #### X/Twitter | 支持ed 文件 formats | JPG, PNG, GIF, 我们bP, HEIC | | | 文件 size limit | 5 MB for static 图片 15 MB for animated GIF | | 📝 Even if an 图片 is within the 文件 size limit, 我们 will check that the 图片 is smaller than 8192 x 8192 pixels, since 这个 is X/Twitter's maximum allo我们d dimension. If it's bigger than that, 您的 图片 will be resized to be just a little smaller. **Gifs on X/Twitter** If 您 see some quality loss or 错误s when creating 您的 帖子 with animated GIFs, 您 can try 这些 recommendations to improve 成功: | GIF Maximum resolution | 1280 x 1080 (width x height) | | | GIF Maximum number of frames | 350 | | | GIF Maximum number of pixels (width * height * num_frames) | 300 million | | #### 链接edIn 我们 支持 both 图片 and document (PDF) scheduling to 链接edIn. | 支持ed 文件 formats | Number of 文件s per post | Recommended 图片 ratio | 文件 size limit | | | 图片s | JPG, PNG, 我们bP *(图片s 上传ed as 我们bP will be converted to PNG), *HEIC, PDF, GIF | up to 9 图片s | 1200x627 | 10 MB | | | Document scheduling | PDF | 1 PDF | N/A | 100MB and 300 pages | | #### 📝 Notes - 链接edIn states that the optimal size for 图片s to achieve consistency across various 分享 methods, pages, and experiences, is 1200 x 627 pixels. 这个 图片 size should prevent cropping and scaling across formats. That said, if 您're looking to 分享 the same 图片 across multiple social networks (e.g. 链接edIn, Facebook, X/Twitter, and Instagram), 我们'd recommend using a square 图片 to avoid cropping on 链接edIn. An important note on p添加ing and 移动端 display from 链接edIn: *“图片s 上传ed in the recommended 1200 x 627 ratio are automatically displayed on the 移动端 应用 with white p添加ing on the 顶部/底部 or 侧边s of the 图片, to fit the ratio without being cropped. Although a 3:2 aspect ratio, or 1200 x 800, displays fully without p添加ing, 我们 recommend using the industry-standard 1200 x 627 ratio. 链接 分享 thumbnail 图片 上传s are displayed in a 2:1 ratio. Limit text in rich media 图片s to the 中心 of the 图片 in a title-safe area.”* #### Pinterest | 支持ed 文件 formats | JPG, PNG, GIF, 我们bP, HEIC | | | 文件 size limit | 10MB | | #### TikTok At 这个 time, TikTok 图片s are only 支持ed on the 我们b version of Aitoearn (TikTok 图片 支持 in 我们的 移动端 应用s coming soon!). | 文件 size limit | up to 8MB | | | Format | JPG, 我们bp (HEIC and PNG will be converted to JPG) | | | Maximum resolution | 1080 x 1920 pixels or 1920 x 1080 pixels | | | 文件 size limit | 20MB | | #### Google Business 个人资料s | 文件 size limit | bet我们en 10Kb and 10 MB | | | Format | JPG, PNG, 我们bP *(图片s 上传ed as 我们bP will be converted to PNG), *HEIC | | | Recommended resolution | 720px x 720px | | | Maximum resolution | 10,000px x 10,000px | | | Minimum resolution | 250px x 250px | | #### Mastodon | 文件 size limit | up to 8MB | | | Format | JPG, PNG | | | Recommended resolution | 1280px x 1280px | | #### Threads | 文件 size limit | up to 8MB | | | Format | JPG, PNG, 我们bP, HEIC | | #### 📝 Notes - 图片s (PNG, JPG, GIF, 我们bP, HEIC) up to 8MB are 支持ed. 图片s will be downscaled to 1.6 megAPIxels (enough for a 1280x1280 图片). - Up to 4 图片s can be attached to one post. - GIFs are converted to 视频s so only 1 GIF can be 支持ed at a time. - Animated GIFs are converted to soundless MP4s like on Imgur/Gfycat (GIFV). 您 can also 上传 soundless MP4 and 我们bM, which will be handled the same way. 学习 more in the article: [Attaching 图片s, 视频s, and other media to 您的 帖子](https://aitoearn.帮助scoutdocs.com/article/615-attaching-图片s-视频s-and-other-media-to-您的-帖子). ### Bluesky | 文件 size limit | 1MB | | | Format | JPG, PNG, 我们bP, HEIC .HEIF | | #### 📝 Notes - 图片s for Bluesky must be under 1MB. 我们 are unable to resize larger 图片s at 这个 time. - GIFs must be under 15MB and 60 seconds in length. ## Saving 您的 文件s and tips for best 图片 quality When scheduling a post through Aitoearn, 我们 send 您的 图片 through API services that can handle 文件s a little differently than if 您 我们re posting directly on the social channel 您的self. 这个 can cause some unexpected results if 图片s are 保存d in certain ways, so 我们 recommend using 这些 tips if 您 are seeing distortion, pixelation, or slight color changes. - 保存 您的 文件 in PNG (.png) 文件 format, rather than .jpg or other 文件 formats. - Avoid transparent backgrounds as they can cause distortion. - If possible, 保存 in sRGB color mode, as 这个 is 什么是 used by most 浏览器s and social networks. Try to stay away from other color modes such as AdobeRBG/CMYK. Not saving in sRGB will result in a slight change of 图片 colors when 发布ed. - Avoid overly large dimensions for 图片s. If the 图片 needs to be resized by Aitoearn or the social platform, it could impact the quality of the 图片. ## 故障排除 图片 orientation issues Sometimes, 图片s might 应用ear to be rotated once they have been 发布ed to 您的 social channel. When 图片s are 上传ed to Aitoearn, 我们 use the orientation data that is hard-coded in the background of the 图片 based on how it was taken or the tool used to process it. 这个 background information is called the EXIF data. Whilst the 图片 may 应用ear to be the correct orientation when previewing it on 您的 computer, or in the composer after 上传ing it in 发布, it might be rotated once 发布ed. If 这个 is h应用ening for 您, 我们 thought 我们'd 分享 [这个 tool](https://www.thexifer.net/#exif-general) that can 移除 the EXIF data from 图片s before 上传ing them. 上传 您的 图片 and then 点击 ***eXif.me***. Check the box to the 右侧 of "EXIF Cleaner" that says "IF CHECKED ALL THE TAGS WILL BE CLEARED" and then 点击 ***Go.eXifing***. 这个 will 移除 the EXIF data from 您的 图片 and then 您 can 下载 the 图片 by 点击ing "下载.me".
