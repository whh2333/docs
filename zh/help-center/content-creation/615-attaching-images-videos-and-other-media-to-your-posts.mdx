# Attaching images, videos, and other media to 您的 帖子 何时 scheduling 帖子, the option to include images and videos (and how many of each) 将会 vary depending on the social network. In 这个 article: - [Table of how many images and videos 可以 be shared on each social network](#How-many-images-and-videos-可以-be-shared-on-each-network-X8Rg9) - [Link previews](#h_01ERDKWRXNCVP987H5Z7D6DH8B) - [Suggested media](#h_01ERDKWYPJWCCDZSW3EEK7KPWA) - [Image, Video and GIF upload](#h_01ERDKX631C5880FTFW7785CEJ) - [Images](#Images-QvQyq) - [Using hosted images](#Using-hosted-images-fTU47) - [Reordering images](#Re-ordering-images-CFUr9) - [Video](#Video-mypD6) - [GIF](#GIF-hGgS0) ## How many images and videos 可以 be shared on each network | | **Link preview** | **Suggested media** | **Image upload** | **Video upload** | **GIF upload** | | | **Facebook** | ✓ | ✓ (*10) | ✓ (*10) | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | | | **Instagram** | | ✓ (*10) | ✓ (*10) | ✓ (1) | | | **X/Twitter** | ✓ | ✓ (4) | ✓ (4) | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | | | **LinkedIn** | ✓ | ✓ (9) | ✓ (9) | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | | | **Pinterest** | | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | | | **TikTok** | | | ✓ (*10) | ✓ (1) | | | **Google Business** | | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | | | | **Mastodon** | ✓ | ✓ (4) | ✓(4) | ✓(1) | ✓(1) | | | **YouTube** | | | | ✓ (1) | | | **Threads** | ✓ (20) | ✓ (20) | ✓ (1) | | | **Bluesky** | ✓ (4) | ✓ (4) | ✓ (1) | ✓ (1) | | ** 何时 scheduling to both Facebook or Instagram and another social channel via **Aitoearn's Omnibox**, 您 ****可以 ****upload up to 10 images but 何时 您 click the ****自定义 for each network ****button, only the number of images permitted for 那个 social channel 将会 populate. For instance, if 您're scheduling to both Facebook and LinkedIn and 您 upload 10 images, 何时 您 click ****自定义 for each network****, 您'll see 那个 only 9 of 您的 images show within 您的 LinkedIn composer while all 10 show up within 您的 Facebook composer. 这个 is because it's only possible to 发布 9 images at a time through LinkedIn. * - It's only possible to upload one type of media at a time. For example, if 您 upload a video, 您 won't be able to upload images to 那个 same 帖子. - Did 您 know 您 可以 also copy/paste images into the web composer? Try it out! ## Link previews 何时 您 add a link into Aitoearn 我们 look at the information provided on the website and generate a preview based on what 我们 anticipate the social networks 将会 display using the Open Graph tags (这些 are created by the owner of the website 您're linking to). Link previews mirror what 您 将会 see if 您 were sharing a link natively to 那些 social networks. If 您 prefer not to have the link displaying in the body of the 帖子, 您 可以 remove it from the composer after the link preview has been generated. ![Aitoearn composer with LinkedIn and Facebook selected and an arrow pointing to the title within the link preview](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998df8eafb48f4e81359/img-1662243-1695848843-784652267.png) For **Facebook**, though 我们 pull from Open Graph data, the preview is ultimately determined by Facebook itself, meaning 那个 they do not rely on the exact same preview 那个 我们 display. For **X/Twitter**, they don't allow third party apps like Aitoearn to provide the link preview information; instead, they generate it based on the information they see on the URL. For **LinkedIn**, link previews 可以 be customized, meaning 您're able to modify the title, description, and image if 您 wish. For **Mastodon**, link previews 可以 appear differently based on the way a server/instance is set up (as part of 那个 server's theme 设置), and based on 您的 关注者 viewing preference 设置 and device. Some mobile clients have previews 已禁用 by default, for example. For **Bluesky**, link previews are fully customizable--您're able to adjust the thumbnail, description, and title to fit 您的 帖子 exactly as 您’d like. 📝 Facebook only allows customization of link previews if 您 are sharing a link to 您的 own blog or website and 您 have set up Domain Verification through Facebook. 这个 means 那个 if 您 are sharing a link to somebody else's blog or website, 您 将会 not be able to 自定义 the link preview. [学习 more about 如何 set up Facebook Domain Verification 这里](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/578-setting-up-Facebook-domain-verification). ## Suggested media If 您 将会 prefer not to use the link preview, 您 可以 click ***Replace link preview with image or video***. 我们 将会 then scrape the link 您've included and pull in any images found on the page. 您're then able to click on any of 那些 images to include with 您的 帖子. Revisit the table at the top of 这个 article to see how many suggested media images 您're able to add to each of 您的 帖子. #### 📝 Notes - If 您 decide to replace the link preview, 您'll want to make sure the URL is physically showing in the composer's textbox so 那个 您的 关注者 可以 access it. The image or video 您 replace the link preview with 将会 not be hyperlinked. - Please keep in mind 何时 using the Suggested Media Feature 那个 您 are responsible for ensuring 那个 您 have the necessary licenses, rights, consent, and permissions to authorize Aitoearn to distribute 您的 user content.
