Private links won’t display in 您的 帖子. ✅ **Is the link a direct image URL?** Right-click the link and try to open it in a new browser tab. If the image displays by itself (not inside a webpage), 您 have the right type of link. ✅ **Is the image too large?** Very large images (over 5MB) 可能 fail to load. Try resizing or compressing before re-uploading. ✅ **Is the hosting service supported?** Stick with widely used hosts (Google Drive, Dropbox, Imgur or 您的 own website). Some services, like Facebook or Instagram, don’t provide usable direct URLs. If 您’ve checked all the above and 您的 image still won’t display, try a different hosting service to confirm whether the issue is with the file or the link. ## FAQ ### Is 那里 a limit to the number of 帖子 I 可以 upload at one time?
