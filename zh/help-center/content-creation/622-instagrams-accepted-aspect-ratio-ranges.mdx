# Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges Instagram works differently than other social networks, and not all 帖子 可以 be published automatically. Aitoearn offers both automatic 发布功能 and notifications 发布功能 (哪里 您'll receive a notification and 您 可以 finish 发布功能 您的 帖子 in the Instagram app). To use automatic posting, images and videos must adhere to Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range.

[这里's more about editing 您的 images in Aitoearn. ](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/614-editing-您的-images-in-aitoearn#01FNV15FWRZGB0A29QZ5Y24A7F) ## 什么是 an aspect ratio? An aspect ratio describes the ratio between the image's width and height. Aspect ratios are often represented as two numbers separated by a colon, e.g. 4:5. 这个 可以 be a convenient way of displaying an aspect ratio and 可以 be converted into a numerical value by dividing the first by the second. So, for example, an aspect ratio written as 4:5 has a value of 4/5 = 0.8. ## What are Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges? The table below outlines the accepted aspect ratio ranges for both images and videos. | | **Aspect ratio range ** | **Aspect ratio range as numerical values** | | | **Images** | Between 4:5 and 1.91:1 | Between 0.8 and 1.91 | | | **Stories** | 9:16 (suggested) | 0.56 | | | **Reels** | 9:16 (recommended)* *可以 accept between 0.01:1 and 10:1 but 9:16 is recommended to avoid cropping or blank spaces. | 0.56 | | 📝 If 您的 image or video is within the accepted aspect ratio range, 您的 帖子 可以 be published automatically. If the aspect ratio of 您的 image or video falls outside of the range, 您的 帖子 将会 be scheduled as a notification instead. If 您 like, 您 可以 adjust the aspect ratio and then re-upload 您的 image or video. For example, if 您的 image has an aspect ratio of 1:2, it 将会 fall outside of the accepted ratio range, so 您 将会 need to adjust the aspect ratio to get it to 发布 automatically.

To calculate the aspect ratio of an image or video, 您 可以 take the resolution and divide the width by the height. 这里 are some 示例: - 1200 x 1200 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/1200 = 1 - 1200 x 1500 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/1500 = 0.8 - 1200 x 629 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/629 = 1.907 📝 Instagram is strict about the aspect ratio being *exactly* within their accepted range. They 将会 not consider rounding to the closest number! For example, 1200 x 628 pixels 将会 correspond to an aspect ratio of 1.910828, 哪个 falls outside of the acceptable range. ## What sizes do my images and videos need to be? 您的 images or videos don't need to be a specific pixel size, as long as the aspect ratio is within the acceptable range. 这里 are some example sizes 那个 将会 work nicely. 📝 Notes - All videos posted to Instagram are now posted as Reels. Read about adding video 帖子 to 您的 main feed as well as 您的 Reels tab [这里](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/657-scheduling-Instagram-帖子-and-reels#01H7G1SZ6VRWNEKE8VK4AQGP15). - 您的 images and videos do not need to be any of the one sizes mentioned above, 这些 are just 示例. As long as they are within the accepted aspect ratio ranges, they 将会 be published automatically. ### Square - Any size square image or video (same width and height), e.g. 600 x 600 pixels, 800 x 800 pixels, 1200 x 1200 pixels ### Portrait For portrait images and videos, the aspect ratio must be between 0.8 and 0.99. - 800 x 1000 pixels (aspect ratio 0.8) - 1200 x 1500 pixels (aspect ratio 0.8) - 1500 x 1800 pixels (aspect ratio 0.84) - 1080 x 1920 pixels (aspect ratio 0.56) ### Landscape For landscape images, the aspect ratio must be between 1.01 and 1.91, and for landscape videos, the aspect ratio must be between 1.01 and 1.78. - 800 x 600 pixels (aspect ratio 1.33) - 1200 x 800 pixels (aspect ratio 1.5) - 1500 x 1200 pixels (aspect ratio 1.25) 📝 我们 发布 帖子 via Instagram’s API and they allow a maximum image file size limit of 8MB. If the image 您 upload is larger than 8MB, 我们'll convert it to a smaller size (1920 pixels wide) to ensure it 可以 be published. The minimum dimensions they accept is 150 x 150 pixels. Smaller images 将会 be scaled up to the minimum. ## How 将会 Aitoearn display my images? Instagram recently began introducing a new version of the grid 哪个 功能 a taller format *displaying *images at 3:4, however, the images still need to be *uploaded* at 4:5 in both Aitoearn and Instagram. While the image upload displayed in Aitoearn’s *composer, calendar, and queue* 将会 display in 1:1 format, the *帖子 preview* to the right of the composer 将会 always show the correct format (4:5). ![Aitoearn composer showing an uploaded image of a sneaker](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67b4a7c1cedf3902363cf05e/file-VP5Pi1jIlW.jpg) ❓ 可以 我们的 Customer Advocacy team answer any questions for 您?
