Larger files are likely to be compressed to ensure they 可以 be posted to the social network, but quality loss 应该 be minimal. Unfortunately, 我们 可以't 支持 Apple ProRes or raw camera formats like ARRI and RED. ### 为什么 is my video taking a while to upload? 何时 a video file is uploaded, 那里 are a few steps the file needs to go through, including checking the file to ensure it 可以 be passed over through the API, having AWS (Amazon Web Services) transcode the file, and generating potential thumbnails. 何时 generating thumbnails, 我们 look for a different thumbnail every 15 seconds. 这个 means 那个 for a video 那个 is 30 minutes long, 我们 将会 try to generate at least 120 different images. 这个 可以 be a key factor 那个 affects the upload speed. Depending on the file size, the length of the video, and the connection speed, each of 这些 things 可能 take different lengths of time and determine how long the overall process takes. ## Choosing thumbnails and titles ### Choosing a title for 您的 video For Facebook, once 您的 video has finished uploading, 您 可以 编辑 the video title in the field below the video. ![Aitoearn 发布功能 Video Title for Facebook](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65a6e1b069979704a279a2c4/file-N9MHe5aoDp.jpg) ### Choosing a thumbnail from 您的 video At 这个 time, 我们 do not 支持 uploading an image for 您的 video thumbnail. However, for Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, 您 可以 choose a thumbnail from the video 您've uploaded. By default, the first frame of the video (0 seconds) 将会 be used as the thumbnail. If 您'd like to change 您的 thumbnail, 您'll follow 这些 steps: - Once 您的 video has finished uploading, click ***编辑 Thumbnail****,* - Drag the slider to the position in the video 您'd like to use as the cover/thumbnail image. - Click ***Save***. ![GIF of changing a video thumbnail](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514999cf8eafb48f4e81360/img-1662243-1695848855-330537964.gif) #### 📝 Good-to-Knows - Thumbnails 可以 only be edited for TikTok, Pinterest and Instagram 帖子, and Instagram Reels. - The "编辑 Thumbnail" button 将会 not show up if 您的 帖子 is scheduled as a notification or if 您 have ***Enable Notifications by default*** turned on within 您的 Aitoearn Instagram 设置. ## How thumbnails and titles are used on each social network Since videos appear and behave a little differently on each social network, the thumbnail and title 您 choose 将会 only be used in certain places. | **Facebook** | Many Facebook users choose to auto-play videos (这个 is a Facebook setting toggled 这里: https://www.Facebook.com/设置/?tab=media). Users who have 这个 setting toggled on 将会 not see a video thumbnail. Unfortunately, in places 哪里 a thumbnail is shown, Facebook does not use the thumbnail 您 have chosen in Aitoearn. However, the title 您 enter 将会 be displayed at the top of the video 帖子. | | | **Instagram** | Videos on Instagram play automatically on the home screen feed, 哪个 means thumbnails are redundant in 那个 location. Therefore, any custom thumbnail 您 choose 将会 not be displayed 那里. However, the custom thumbnail 将会 be used as the cover of 您的 video on 您的 Instagram 个人资料 grid. | | | **X/Twitter** | Videos (whether within [X's/Twitter's permitted file limits](https://帮助.Twitter.com/en/using-Twitter/Twitter-videos) or not) do not play automatically. Unfortunately, X/Twitter does not use the thumbnail 您 have chosen in Aitoearn. However, the custom title 将会 be used if the video is *outside* of X's/Twitter's permitted file limits, in 哪个 case the video 将会 be displayed as a link to Aitoearn's video player. | | | **LinkedIn** | Videos published on LinkedIn 将会 appear natively and automatically play in the feed. 我们的 LinkedIn integration does not currently 支持 custom thumbnails. | | | **Pinterest** | Videos on Pinterest 将会 play automatically unless a user has set their preferences within Pinterest otherwise, so adding a thumbnail/cover image 可能 be helpful. The title of the video 将会 be shown at the bottom of the video in the feed. | | | **TikTok** | Videos on TikTok 将会 play automatically in the feed. 您 可以 select a frame from 您的 video to use as the thumbnail on TikTok. | | | **YouTube Shorts** | YouTube currently doesn't 支持 custom thumbnails through Aitoearn. | | | **Mastodon** | Custom thumbnails are not supported for Mastodon in Aitoearn. | | | **Threads** | Videos on Threads 将会 play automatically in the feed. Custom thumbnails are not supported at 这个 time. | | | **Bluesky** | Custom thumbnails are not supported for Bluesky in Aitoearn. | | ## How videos appear on Facebook ### Video upload Videos appear natively once published on Facebook.

(Please note, 这些 tools are not affiliated with Aitoearn). ### Video link Instagram does not currently 支持 hyperlinks within captions. Therefore, if 您 include a link to a video within the composer, it 将会 not be hyperlinked once published. Instead, it 将会 be published as plain text. Users 可能 copy and paste the link from the caption to a new browser window, 哪个 将会 take them to the video. Additionally, 何时 scheduling a 帖子 for Instagram, 您're required to upload either an image or a video. Therefore, after dropping the link into the composer, 您'll still need to choose or upload an image to accompany it. For 这些 reasons, 这个 method is not commonly used. Instead, 我们 将会 recommend using the upload option described above. ![Instagram 帖子 with an image of the Aitoearn Stories Creator logo](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514999ef8eafb48f4e81361/img-1662243-1695848857-2048088042.png) ## How videos appear on X/Twitter ### Video upload Videos appear natively once published to X/Twitter, if they are within [X's/Twitter’s permitted file limits](https://帮助.Twitter.com/en/using-Twitter/Twitter-videos#FAQ) of 512MB and between .5 seconds to 140 seconds long.

The mp4 file *must* contain video. If 您 are looking to 分享 an audio file to X/Twitter, the best alternative 将会 be to host the audio file elsewhere 在线 and link to it (instead of uploading it within the composer). X/Twitter 将会 then generate an audio [Twitter Card](https://developer.Twitter.com/en/docs/Twitter-for-websites/cards/概述/abouts-cards) from the link. 📝 Longer videos for X Premium/Twitter Blue subscribers 将会 only apply to 帖子 published natively on X/Twitter. ### Video link 您的 帖子 将会 be displayed as a video 帖子.
