For example, "运行ner's World" 可能 be typed as "运行ners_World" to find the right page. - Some brands have multiple Facebook Pages under the same name, making it difficult to identify the page 您're looking for. [这里's an example](https://分享.aitoearn.com/9ZuE7Le5). Each Facebook Page has an ID, 哪个 is the string of numbers 那个 appear in the list of matching results. 您 可以 find 哪个 ID relates to 哪个 page by heading to [https://Facebook.com/](https://Facebook.com/)***page-id-这里*** (哪里 您'd replace ***page-id-这里*** with one of 那些 IDs). 您'd then be taken to 那个 specific page. ## X/Twitter mentions Due to API limitations, 我们’re not able to autocomplete mentions of X/Twitter accounts. 那个 said, 您 可以 still include mentions in 您的 帖子 but 您 将会 need to type in the exact handle 您’d like to include.

The 个人资料 isn’t 关注中 您的 LinkedIn organization page For a tag to work, the person 您're trying to mention must be 关注中 您的 company’s LinkedIn page. **如何 verify:** - As the Page Admin, go to 您的 company page, click on the number of 关注者, and search for the name of the person 您're trying to mention. - Alternatively, the person 您're trying to mention 可以 verify if they're 关注中 您的 page. #### 2. The 个人资料 has 个人资料 visibility turned off If someone has restricted their 个人资料 visibility, they 可能 not appear as an option to mention 何时 您're composing a 帖子. #### 3. Third-party data sharing is turned off LinkedIn allows users to limit how their data is shared with external tools and services. If 这个 setting is 已禁用, it 可以 prevent them from being mentioned outside of LinkedIn directly. #### 4. Mentions are 已禁用 on their 账户 LinkedIn users 可以 choose to prevent others from mentioning them in 帖子 or 评论. If 这个 setting is off, they won’t be taggable. #### 5. The 个人资料 has restricted access to their 个人资料 If the person 您’re trying to tag has blocked 您 or set their 个人资料 visibility so 您 可以’t view it, 您 won’t be able to tag them. **Note: **Items 2-5 in the above list 可以 only be verified by the LinkedIn 个人资料 owner within their 账户 设置. Therefore, if 您've confirmed 那个 the 个人资料 is 关注中 您的 Page, 您 可以 ask the 个人资料 owner to check the 关注中: - If 那里 is any missing piece of information about the 个人资料 being tagged, including First Name, Last Name, or Headline. - If 您 are trying to match a 个人资料 您 want to tag based on the Maiden Name or Additional Name, 那个 information is not publicly visible. - In case 那里 are any misspelled characters, hidden spaces in the name, etc. - If the user’s 个人资料 您 are tagging is not in EN_US, it won’t be returned under suggestions. ## Mastodon mentions 您 可以 mention users by typing out their full address, e.g. @jane@exampleserver.com. Note 那个 any usage of @word 将会 be interpreted as mentioning the local user with the username word, if 那个 user exists. Only the username part 将会 count against 您的 character limit - the domain is not counted. ## TikTok mentions 您 可以 mention a TikTok user by typing out their exact handle in the caption of 您的 帖子 (e.g. @‌aitoearnapp). Once published to TikTok, the 账户 您 mentioned 将会 become hyperlinked. ## Threads mentions At 这个 time, 我们’re not able to autocomplete mentions of Threads or Instagram accounts. 那个 said, 您 可以 still include mentions in 您的 Threads 帖子 but 您 将会 need to type in the exact handle 您’d like to include. Once published, the mention 应该 be hyperlinked. ## Bluesky mentions Tag other users by inputting their full handle, eg: @name.bsky.social. 我们 don’t currently offer autocomplete of handles, so make sure to type the handle correctly, or copy/paste from their page!
