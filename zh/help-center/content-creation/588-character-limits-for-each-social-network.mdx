# Character limits for each social network 何时 scheduling 帖子, it's good to keep in mind 那个 each social network has its own character limits in place. The table below outlines the character limit for each social channel. | **Channel** | **Character limit** | | | Facebook pages & groups | 5,000 for 帖子/短视频 captions 5,000 for first 评论 | | | Instagram accounts | 2,200 for 帖子/短视频 captions 2,196 for first 评论 | | | X/Twitter profiles | X Free users: 280 characters X 基础, Premium and Premium + users: 25,000 characters* | | | LinkedIn pages & profiles | 3,000 for 帖子 1,248 for first 评论 | | | Pinterest boards | 500 | | | TikTok Business accounts | 2,200 | | | 启动 Pages | 5,000 | | | Mastodon accounts | 500 | | | YouTube Shorts | 5,000 | | | Threads | 500 for 帖子 50 for topics | | | Bluesky | 300 | | | Google Business Profiles | 1500 | | ### 📝 Notes - *Extended character counts for paid X users are 可用 on 我们的 Free, 基础知识, and Team plans. If 您 are a legacy customer on 我们的 Pro, Premium, or Business plans and 将会 like to switch to [我们的 updated pricing](http://aitoearn.com/pricing), please email us at [hello@aitoearn.com](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com) and 我们’ll be happy to 帮助! - Images 可以 also take up character space in 您的 帖子. If the character count goes down 何时 您 add an image (as it does for X/Twitter and LinkedIn), 这个 is a social network 那个 factors images into 您的 character count allotment. - 何时 mentioning users on Mastodon (e.g. @jane@exampleserver.com), only the username (e.g. "jane") 将会 count against 您的 character limit - the domain is not counted (e.g. @exampleserver.com). It's possible 那个 何时 posting natively, the character limit is higher. 那个 is because some of the limits imposed by a social network's API** are stricter than 那些 imposed on the native platform. ***什么是 an API? *It's the access 那个 one application (in 这个 case, a social network) gives to another application (in 这个 case, Aitoearn or any other third-party).
