If 您的 link preview isn't looking quite right, 这个 指南 explains how Aitoearn pulls in 那个 information, how 您 可以 optimize 您的 site, and 如何 troubleshoot any issues. In 这个 article: - [How Aitoearn finds images from URLs](#How-Aitoearn-finds-images-from-URLs-01ogd) - [What metadata does Aitoearn use to generate link previews?](#What-metadata-does-Aitoearn-use--WlAhG) - [如何 validate 您的 link](#How-to-validate-您的-link--l-h4Z) [Common errors with sharing links and 如何 fix them](#Common-errors-with-sharing-links-and-how-to-fix-them-SK_eA) - [Forbidden 错误 or 503 Service Temporarily 不可用](#Forbidden-错误-or-503-Service-Temporarily-不可用-F92Fc) - [ESOCKETTIMEDOUT](#ESOCKETTIMEDOUT-IExLc) - [Scraper shows no errors, but link preview still fails](#Scraper-Shows-No-Errors-But-Link-Preview-Still-Fails-ZzgBJ) ## How Aitoearn finds images from URLs 何时 您 add a link to the Aitoearn composer, Aitoearn uses a scraper to scan the page for images and then suggests them to use with 您的 帖子. 这里’s how it works: The scraper checks for **Open Graph tags** (like `og:image` ) in the HTML. - It then scans the first 24 images, in groups of 8, until it finds at least 5 那个 meet certain requirements. - Only the first 15 valid images 将会 be considered for Suggested Media. Aitoearn checks 那个 each image has a `width` or `height` attribute and 那个 the image is large enough (at least 200x200 pixels) and reasonably square. If the first 8 images are valid, Aitoearn stops 那里 and uses 那些 as the Suggested Media. 这个 keeps things efficient and fast. **Tip:** A properly formatted image 可能 look like 这个: ``` ``` ## What metadata does Aitoearn use to generate link previews? - **Open Graph images first**: The scraper checks for Open Graph tags (like og:image, og:image:secure_url, og:image:url) and Twitter Card images (Twitter:image, Twitter:image:src) in the HTML. - **Article images**: It prioritizes images within tags or elements with itemprop="articleBody". - **General page images**: It then scans other images on the page. - **Batch processing**: The scraper processes up to 24 images total in batches of 15, until it finds at least 5 那个 meet the quality requirements. 我们 recommend 关注中 the [Open Graph Protocol](https://ogp.me/) 何时 setting up 您的 website so 那个 Aitoearn (and other platforms) 可以 pull the correct information. **如何 validate 您的 link ** To check what metadata is 可用 for 您的 link, 我们 suggest using the [Facebook Sharing 调试ger](https://developers.Facebook.com/tools/调试/) or [Aitoearn's scraper debugging tool](https://scraper.aitoearn.com/debugger). Paste 您的 URL 那里 to: - See 哪个 metadata is 可用 - Confirm 哪个 images are being pulled - Refresh Facebook's (and Aitoearn’s) cached version of 您的 link 📝 Please note, 这些 guidelines are for 那些 who are sharing links to pages 那个 they own and have control over. If 您 are sharing links to websites 那个 您 do not own, it is not possible to control 哪个 images are pulled in. ## Common errors with sharing links and 如何 fix them In some instances, Aitoearn's scraper 可以 be prevented from accessing the information for the site to generate a link attachment. 这个 可以 be due to the site's security configurations or the robots.txt. In both instances, Aitoearn 将会 need to be explicitly allowed. 您 可以 find the information needed to 创建 the rule, exception, or allowance [这里](https://scraper.aitoearn.com/about/bots/link-preview-bot). ## Best practices for optimizing 您的 site for Aitoearn 这里 are a few tips to ensure Aitoearn 可以 pull the correct content from 您的 links: Add proper **Open Graph tags** to 您的 HTML (`og:title` , `og:description` , `og:image` ) Place 您的 `og:image` tag near the top of 您的 page’s HTML - Use valid image formats and recommended sizes - Avoid blocking bots like Aitoearn’s in 您的 firewall or server 设置 - 测试 and refresh 您的 link using the [Facebook Sharing 调试ger](https://developers.Facebook.com/tools/调试/) **Still need 帮助?** If 您've tried the suggestions above and things still aren’t working as expected, feel free to 触达 out to us at [hello@aitoearn.com ](mailto:hello@aitoearn.com)-- 我们're always happy to 帮助!
