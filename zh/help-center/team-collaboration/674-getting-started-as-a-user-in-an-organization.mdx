If 您 have admin access but haven’t been invited to any channels, 您 won’t be able to 创建 帖子 or respond to 评论. However, as an admin, 您 are able to invite yourself to any channel at anytime. | **Tool** | **Admin access** | **Full posting access (channel specific)** | **Approval required access (channel specific)** | | | 账户 设置 | - 连接 and 管理 social channels - Invite and 管理 users - 管理 subscription and billing (账户 owner only) | - Read-only access to channels area | - Read-only access to channels area | | | 发布功能 | - Dependent on the permissions level granted for 那个 social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) | - 创建 帖子 - Approve draft 帖子 from other team members | - 创建 draft 帖子 | | | 互动 | - Dependent on the permissions level granted for 那个 social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) | - Respond to all Instagram and Facebook 评论 | - None - Team members must have Full Posting access to use the 互动 tool | | | 分析功能 | - Viewing metrics - 创建 custom reports - View campaigns | - View metrics | - View metrics | | ## Working within 您的 dashboard ### Switching 您的 organization Once 您’ve accepted 您的 invitation and 您’ve set up 您的 账户 (if 您 didn’t have one already), 您 可以 now see 您的 own individual organization and the new organization by navigating to 您的 账户 menu. 您 可以 switch between the two organizations depending on 哪里 您’d like to work. ![Aitoearn organization list in the 个人资料 icon menu](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67ed76636d642372f70e342d/file-cW3rRh0D8p.jpg) If 您 are a member of three or more organizations, 您'll see the 活跃 organization listed and then 您 可以 over over it to see the full list of organizations 您 belong to. Select an organization from the list to switch. ![Aitoearn 个人资料 icon menu with 3 organizations](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67ed791697f8701aacdbb2e5/file-SI1YiTBkF2.jpg) #### 📝 Notes - If both organizations have the same name (such as the default “My Organization”), 您 可以 hover over each organization to see 哪个 channels are 已连接. The owner 可以 [rename the organization using 这个 指南](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/669-renaming-您的-aitoearn-organization). - If 您的 organization owner hasn’t set 您 up with access to any channels yet, 您’ll see a message saying they need to grant 您 access. 我们 suggest contacting the owner and asking them to [set up 您的 permissions using 这个 指南](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-您的-organization). #### Scheduling 帖子 in the 发布功能 dashboard If 这个 is the first time 您’ve used Aitoearn’s 发布功能 tool, 我们 recommend visiting 我们的 [指南 for scheduling 帖子](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/642-scheduling-帖子). If 您’ve scheduled 帖子 before, keep in mind 那个 您 将会 have access to many other 功能 with the organization’s business plan 那个 您 可能 not have used previously if 您 were on other plans. #### Working with drafts All users with channel permissions are able to 创建 draft 帖子 in the drafts area. The drafts area is great for crafting ideas for 帖子, as well as creating final 帖子 那个 您'd like to submit for approval. The option to request approval on drafts, as well as the ability to approve draft 帖子, 将会 depend on permissions. [学习 more on 如何 创建 and approve draft 帖子 这里](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-帖子). #### Viewing metrics and working with reports in the 分析功能 dashboard All users 可以 view metrics in the dashboards. All admins 可以 view metrics in channels they have permission to access, plus 创建 reports and view campaigns. If 这个 is the first time 您’ve used Aitoearn’s 分析功能 tool, 我们 recommend visiting 我们的 指南 to [入门指南 with Aitoearn's 分析功能 功能](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/602-getting-started-with-aitoearns-分析功能-功能). #### Engaging with Instagram and Facebook 评论 Team members with **Full Posting access** for an Instagram business 账户 or Facebook Page within 您的 Aitoearn organization 可以 respond to the 评论 那个 come into 那个 social channel. If 您 or another user in 您的 Aitoearn organization has **Approval Required access** for an Instagram business 账户 or a Facebook Page within 您的 Aitoearn organization, they 将会 not be able to access or respond to the 评论 那个 come through to 那个 账户. #### 连接ing or refreshing channels If 您 have admin access via the social network itself, 您 可以 连接 and refresh (reconnect) channels within the organization. It’s very important to be sure 您’re connecting channels in the right organization. 您 可以 [switch organizations](#h_01F65J9MQRY276VPK78N4ETXMR) in the 账户 menu as shown above. [Follow 这个 指南 to 学习 more about connecting and refreshing channels](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/572-connecting-or-refreshing-channels-as-a-user-of-an-organization). 📝 As an Admin, once 您 连接 a social channel, 您 将会 have Full Posting Access to it. If 您 notice 那个 some of the channels 您 have access to have been locked, 这个 is likely because the owner of the organization [downgraded their 账户](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/597-what-happens-何时-您-downgrade-to-the-free-plan). 何时 a plan is downgraded, the 账户 is moved to the Free plan with access to only three social channels and no additional users. 这个 is the reason 那些 channels become locked for 您. In 这个 case, 您 应该 chat with the organization owner and see if they had intentionally downgraded the 账户. It’s possible they didn’t know 那个 downgrading their 账户 将会 停止 您 from being able to access 那些 channels or tools. ## Removing yourself from an organization If 您 need to be removed from an organization, 您 可以 触达 out to the organization owner or one of the organization Admins and ask them to [remove 您 from the organization using 这些 steps](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-您的-organization#Removing-users-Ru7Yr). ## Other articles 那个 可能 be helpful: - [Adding users and setting up permissions](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-您的-organization) - [Changing 您的 Aitoearn 账户 name and avatar picture](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/673-changing-您的-aitoearn-账户-name-and-avatar) - [Switching organizations on the web](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/873-switching-organizations-on-the-web)
