So, 哪个 plan 将会 be best for 您? - If 您 need access for only one user, 我们 recommend the **基础知识 **plan. - If 您 have one or more people collaborating with 您 in Aitoearn and/or are looking for exportable, self-branded reports, 我们的 **Team plan** 将会 be the best choice. **学习 more about 我们的 plans and pricing 这里**. **What counts as a channel?** A channel is each individual Page, group, or 个人资料 那个 您’d like to 连接. As an example, 您 可能 be scheduling 帖子 for 10 clients who each have five social channels (e.g. Facebook Page, Instagram 账户, 2 LinkedIn Pages, and Pinterest 个人资料). 这个 将会 come to 50 channels in total. ## 连接ing 您的 clients' channels 那里 are two ways 您 可以 get 您的 clients’ social channels set up in Aitoearn: - 您 (the 账户 owner) 可以 连接 them, or - 您的 client 可以 连接 them if they are designated as an Admin on 您的 Aitoearn 账户. See below for important considerations with 这个 option. Let’s chat about both of 这些 options below so 那个 您 可以 make the best choice for 您的 organization. ### Option 1: 您 (the 账户 owner) 连接 all social channels To 连接 all of 您的 clients’ social channels, 您’ll need to have admin permissions or login credentials for each of the social channels 那个 need to be 已连接. Each social network is a little different, and the table below 分享 more about 什么是 involved in obtaining admin access for each of the social networks Aitoearn integrates with. | **Facebook Page** | 您的 personal Facebook 个人资料 must be an admin on the Facebook Page. 学习 more about [connecting 您的 Facebook Page to Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/569-connecting-您的-Facebook-page-to-aitoearn). | | | **Facebook group** | 您的 personal Facebook 个人资料 将会 need to be an admin on the group. 学习 about [connecting Facebook groups and 故障排除 connections](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/570-connecting-Facebook-groups-and-故障排除-connections). | | | **Instagram business 账户** | Client's login details (username and password) to 连接 the channel to Aitoearn and 发布 via notifications. To use 分析 & Engage, 您'll also need login details for 您的 personal Facebook 个人资料 那个 has Admin permissions on the Page associated to the Instagram 账户 so 您 可以 [authorize Instagram to Aitoearn via the linked Facebook page](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/568-connecting-您的-Instagram-business-or-creator-账户-to-aitoearn#If-这些-steps-still-dont-work-您-可以-also-连接-to-Aitoearn-by-lin--Cdq3). | | **X/Twitter 个人资料** | Client’s login details (username and password). | | | **LinkedIn Page** | 您的 personal LinkedIn 个人资料 将会 need to have Super Admin access to the Page. 学习 more about [using LinkedIn with Aitoearn](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/560-using-LinkedIn-with-aitoearn#01H84S2QQBHPC7W8Q3ZMV9X4YK). | | | **LinkedIn 个人资料** | Client’s login details (username and password). | | | **Pinterest board** | Client’s login details (username and password). | | | **Google Business 个人资料** | 您的 Google 账户 must be [added as a 管理r of the Google Business 个人资料](https://支持.google.com/business/answer/3403100?hl=en). | | | **TikTok** | Client’s login details (username and password). | | | **YouTube** | Client's login details (username and password). | | | **Mastodon** | Client's login details (username and password). | | | **Bluesky** | Client's login details (username and password). | | 何时 it comes to connecting multiple Instagram accounts, 我们 do not recommend managing more than 5 Instagram accounts in total and 我们 also recommend each Instagram 账户 be 已连接 to an authentic, 活跃 Facebook page. 那里 are several considerations and reasons for 这些 recommendations, 哪个 您 可以 read in 我们的 [Instagram best practices](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/553-Instagram-best-practices). ### Option 2: 您的 client connects each of their social channels While it’s possible for users on 您的 账户 那个 are designated with the Admin permission to 连接 their own social channels, **那里 are two important considerations to keep in mind if 您 decide to go 这个 route:** - Admins have the ability to 管理 any social channel 已连接 to 您的 Aitoearn organization. - Admins 将会 be able to access the billing 设置 on the billing page ([https://账户.aitoearn.com/billing](https://账户.aitoearn.com/billing)). If the other social channels 已连接 to 您的 Aitoearn organization are confidential (such as if 您 have many clients and don’t want each to have access to one another’s social channels), or 您 do not want 您的 client to have access to the billing page of 您的 账户, 您’ll want to move forward with [the first option to 连接 social channels explained above](#01GEMSJN2Q3EHTHXSQ5G08G7K5). ## Giving 您的 clients and staff the right permission levels 那里 are four main permissions 可用 on 您的 Aitoearn plan: - Organization owner/账户 owner - Admin - Full posting access (channel specific) - Approval required access (channel specific) Let’s talk about 何时 using each 可能 be most advantageous. To see a broader explanation of all of 这些 permissions, head to the article: [Adding users and setting up permissions in 您的 organization](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-您的-organization). **Organization owner:** The person who has access to the email address and password 那个 the billing is under is the organization owner. 那里 isn’t a way to designate a second owner, but 我们 可以 transfer ownership to another Aitoearn user if needed. The organization owner 将会 always have Full Posting access on all channels and 这个 cannot be changed. 您 可以 read more about Full Posting access below. If 您 as the organization owner need to submit 帖子 for approval to a client, 您 可能 consider creating a different Aitoearn 账户 with a different email address and invite 那个 user to have Admin access of the organization, but Approval Required access on the social channels 您’ll need to submit for approval. With 这个 solution, 您 将会 need to login under 您的 owner 账户 to access 您的 billing information, but 您 应该 be able to do most other tasks via 您的 new user 账户, such as 创建 帖子, 管理 users, 自定义 posting schedules, and 连接 new channels (just make sure to select the correct organization). **Admin:** 这个 permission affects access to 您的 entire Aitoearn organization. 您’ll give admin permission to anyone on 您的 team who 您’d like to have a full range of access, including connecting and removing social channels, creating and printing reports, viewing posting tag 成功, replying to all incoming Facebook and Instagram 评论, and posting to all social channels 已连接 to 您的 Aitoearn 账户. **Full Posting access:** 这个 permission affects access to individual social channels. Many agencies set their clients up with Full Posting access on one or more of their social channels. 这个 allows them to add 帖子, delete 帖子, assign 帖子 to specific tags, and approve 帖子 drafts on 那个 specific social channel. 您 可以 also set 您的 own team members up with Full Posting access for any social channel they have permission to 创建 帖子 for. Users with Full Posting access 可以 view 分析功能 for 那些 social channels, as well as respond to the 评论 made on the 帖子 of 那些 social channels (for Facebook and Instagram). **Approval Required access:** 这个 permission affects access to individual social channels. If 您 don’t want 您的 clients or team members to add 帖子 to the 活跃 queue of a specific social channel, but instead 将会 like them to draft 帖子 那个 您 可以 review before they are scheduled to 发布, setting them up with Approval Required access for 那个 social channel is a great move. Users with Approval Required access 可以 view 分析功能, but cannot respond to the 评论 made on the 帖子 of 那些 social channels. **What if my ***client ***needs to approve the 帖子 my agency creates?** If 帖子 need approval from clients, 您‘ll set 您的 staff up with Approval Required access and 您的 clients with Full Posting access for the social channels they’ll be working on. From 那里, the flow 将会 be for 您的 staff to 创建 帖子 within the drafts area and then request approval. The client 将会 be able to review, 编辑, and approve 那些 帖子, at 哪个 point they’ll be moved to the 活跃 queue. 学习 more about [managing and approving draft 帖子](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-帖子), and make sure to revisit the “Organization owner” section just above. ### 📝 Good-to-knows - If 您的 staff members have Approval Required access on a social channel, all 帖子 they add to 那个 social channel’s drafts area 将会 need to be approved by the client. It is not possible to pick and choose 哪个 帖子 require approval. - If 您的 staff members have Approval Required access, they won’t have the ability to 自定义 那个 channel's [posting 调度](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-您的-timezones-and-posting-schedules), modify any 帖子 in the queue, rearrange the order in 哪个 they’ll be sent, or 配置 custom 发布功能 times for 帖子 那个 are already scheduled. 这些 actions need to be completed by the organization owner, the client, or anyone else with Full Posting access. - At 这个 time, all users within an organization are able to view all 帖子 added to all tags via the 发布功能 dashboard ([https://发布.aitoearn.com/tags](https://发布.aitoearn.com/tags)). 这个 includes 帖子 belonging to social channels 那个 the user does not have Full Posting access or Approval Required access to. Without the appropriate permissions, however, the user 将会 not be able to 编辑 那些 帖子, 创建 帖子, or access the queue for 那个 channel. The only access they have is to view 哪个 帖子 are associated with 哪个 tags. - To change the order 您的 channels appear in the channel menu, 您 可以 drag and drop into 您的 desired order by clicking on a channel, moving it with 您的 mouse, and then releasing it. ![Aitoearn 发布 - reordering channels in the left sidebar](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b668cc067e9c553dc8259d/file-oHac4uioMb.gif) # Managing draft approvals from clients as an 账户 owner ## Creating another 个人资料 to have 您的 drafts approved As the owner of the Aitoearn organization, 您的 Aitoearn 账户 has permanent Full Posting access, meaning 那个 any 帖子 您 创建 将会 be added to the queue and 可以't be sent for approval. So as a workaround, 您 可以 创建 another Aitoearn 账户 for yourself with a separate email address and 创建 您的 drafts to be approved 何时 signed into 那个 user 个人资料. To see how 这个 可以 work, watch the video below to see 这个 in action: ## Using the drafts or 创建 area Set up a cadence with 您的 client (eg: every Monday) to look at the drafts area or 创建 area to review the new 帖子 您've created. 您的 client 可以 then leave 评论 on the 帖子, approve them, or ask for revision. 学习 more about [creating ideas with Aitoearn](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/589-creating-ideas-in-aitoearn) and [creating 帖子 from the drafts area](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/656-saving-and-scheduling-draft-帖子#h_01G3V0JF72D5RCVBH04T1VXAZA).
