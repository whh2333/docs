In 这个 article: - [Video: Adding users and setting up permissions](#Adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-video-iS66c) - [How users work within 您的 organization](#h_01EJGFQ1G262ZRC188AQDXDVDY) - [User permissions and access](#h_01EJGFT20P5NVRX8N5QNMNNPHC) - [Inviting users](#h_a374af7f-8c95-4edb-ab97-0e12dc4b217d) - [Assigning permissions](#Assigning-permissions-BxNSK) - [Removing users](#Removing-users-Ru7Yr) - [FAQ](#FAQ-C3CZx) ## Video: Adding users and setting up permissions Watch the video below to 学习 more about adding users and being part of a Aitoearn organization. ## How users work within 您的 organization Each individual Aitoearn user has their own organization (哪里 they 可以 连接 personal channels 那个 only they have access to), and they 可以 also be part of *other* organizations as a *user* with different levels of permissions. #### Notes - 您的 users 将会 always access 您的 organization’s channels on their own Aitoearn dashboard and they 将会 never need to log into 您的 Aitoearn 账户. - 您的 users 将会 have access to all of the business 功能 of 您的 organization 何时 working with 您的 channels -- even if they have a different plan. Most users of an organization have a Free plan. In the **发布功能 dashboard**, 您的 team members 将会 be able to 创建 and 分享 draft 帖子, and 您 可以 define 哪个 users 应该 have their 帖子 approved. 帖子 created by 您的 users 将会 be shared within 您的 [posting 调度](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-您的-timezones-and-posting-schedules). 您'll be able to see who created each 帖子 何时 viewing the queue. In the **分析功能 dashboard**, 您的 team members 将会 be able to view metrics for any channel they have permission to access. Admins have the additional ability to 创建 reports and access tag metrics. In the **互动 dashboard**, users within 您的 Aitoearn organization who have Full Posting access to 您的 organization's Instagram business accounts or Facebook Pages 可以 respond to 评论 那个 come through for 那些 accounts. ## User permissions and access 我们 have a few different permission levels. 何时 adding a new user to 您的 organization, 您 可以 choose 哪个 social channels they see in their Aitoearn dashboard. For each of 那些 channels, 您 可以 choose whether they have ***Full Posting access*** or ***Approval Required*** access. ***Full Posting access*** includes the ability to 创建, 调度, and 发布 帖子 for any channel they've been invited to. ***Approval Required access*** includes the ability to 创建 a draft for admin/owner approval. (Note they 将会 not be able to 创建 帖子 from the Calendar view). 这里's a video 那个 explains the process of [Requesting Approval and Approving Draft 帖子](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-帖子#01EKCQWCD3GENS0BW0QGHD6KJQ). Lastly, 您 可以 decide if any of 您的 users 应该 have ***Admin*** capability. Choose wisely, as users with Admin access have full control over all the channels 您've 已连接. Users with admin access won't automatically have access to all channels and 将会 need to be added or add themselves to channels. Admins 可以 also 连接 new channels. | **Tool** | **Admin access** | **Full posting access (channel specific)** | **Approval required access (channel specific)** | | | 账户 设置 | - 连接 and 管理 social channels - Invite and 管理 users - 管理 subscription and billing | - Read-only access to channels area | - Read-only access to channels area | | | 发布功能 | - Dependent on permissions level granted for 那个 social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) - 创建, 编辑, and delete tags from tags list - 创建 ideas and view all ideas within the organization - 创建 groups for ideas | - 创建 帖子 - 编辑 and delete scheduled 帖子 - Approve draft 帖子 from other team members - Adjust posting schedules - Add or remove tags from scheduled 帖子 - 创建 ideas and view all ideas within the organization - 创建 帖子 with Shop Grid links - 编辑 帖子 with Shop Grid links | - 创建 draft 帖子 - 创建 ideas and view all ideas within the organization - Add or remove tags from scheduled 帖子 - 创建 帖子 with Shop Grid links (need to be approved by team member with Full Posting Access) - Not able to 编辑 Shop Grid links | | | 互动 | - Dependent on permissions level granted for 那个 social channel (Full Posting or Approval Required access) | - Respond to all Instagram and Facebook 评论 | - None - Team members must have Full Posting access to use the 互动 tool | | | 分析功能 | - Viewing metrics - 创建 custom reports - View tags | - View metrics | - View metrics | | | 启动 Page | - 启动 Page creation - 编辑ing | - No access | - No access | | ## Inviting users 我们的 Team plan supports unlimited team members, so 您 可以 invite 您的 team to 帮助 您 创建 and 管理 您的 content.
