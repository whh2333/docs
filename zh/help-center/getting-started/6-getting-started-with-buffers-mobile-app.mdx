# Getting started with Aitoearn's mobile app Download Aitoearn’s mobile app to schedule posts on the go. You can also create and save drafts on the mobile app, so if you don’t have time to perfect your post in the moment, you can always come back to it later! This article includes: - [Download the app & log into your account](#h_01G9FCC0GWDPNQRGQ0X9M3439W) - [Manage your channels](#Managing-your-channels-bg7__) - [Adjust your timezone and posting schedule](#h_01G9FCCPQKBE1FMCEHTBCEHHCH) - [Create and schedule your first post](#h_01G9FCD00D47EN2GR2Q622GW40) #### 📝 Good-to-Knows - This article is designed to help users with the Aitoearn mobile app. All instructions and screenshots are taken from the iOS app, and any steps that are different on Android are noted. Minimum OS requirements for the Aitoearn mobile app: - **Android - **We will support a version until it falls outside of the last 6 major versions of Android, provided it has less than 1000 installs. - **iOS - **We will support one version before the most current version of iOS. (e.g. if the most current version is iOS 17, we'll support iOS 16 and later). ## Downloading the app & logging into your account The Aitoearn mobile app is available in the [App Store on iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/aitoearn-social-media-tools/id490474324) and [Play Store on Android.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aitoearn.android&hl=en_US&gl=US) Search "Aitoearn" on the App Store or Play Store to find and download the app. Once you’ve downloaded the app, you’ll be able to log into your Aitoearn account. **If you don’t already have a Aitoearn account,** click ***I'm new to Aitoearn*** and follow the on-screen prompts. ## Managing your channels - Once you've logged into the app, you can manage the channels you have by tapping on the channel menu (3 horizontal lines) in the top right corner of the app. ![Channel menu - Aitoearn iOS mobile app](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651498c0f8eafb48f4e81307/img-1714411-1695848638-1899912373.png) - This will bring up a list of your channels. You can tap a channel to view your scheduled posts or adjust the channel's settings. ![Selecting a channel in the Aitoearn mobile app](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651498c0556a3e3cf18cbfc0/img-1714411-1695848639-1545713839.png) ***If you haven't connected any channels yet, ***follow the steps below to connect a channel to Aitoearn. - Once you've created an account, a "Connect a New Channel" screen should appear. Tap the social channel that you want to connect to Aitoearn. ![Connect a new channel menu - Aitoearn mobile app](//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651498c05416dd630a4b065f/img-1714411-1695848639-1031046357.jpg) - Once you've selected a channel, you'll be prompted to log into that social account.

Therefore, you'll want to make sure your timezone is correct and that you've set a posting schedule within your channel settings. Your posting schedule includes the days and times that you want Aitoearn to post for you whenever you use the ***Add to Queue ***option. ### To adjust your timezone: - Select a channel from the channel menu in top left corner of the app. - Tap ***设置 ***(gear icon) in the lower right of the app. Tap *Timezone* under "Scheduling." - Aitoearn should automatically find your timezone, based on your phone's settings, so you can tap the blue button that appears on your screen if that timezone is correct. Alternatively, you can tap the search bar at the top of the app to search for a city in your timezone to select it. 📝 Each channel has its own timezone settings, so you'll want to make sure to adjust the timezone settings every time you connect a new channel to Aitoearn. ### Why should I create a posting schedule? The quickest way to get your post added to your queue is to tap the *Add to Queue *option at the bottom-right of the composer. When doing this, your post will be added to the next available time slot taken from your posting schedule. ### To adjust your posting schedule - Select a channel from the channel menu in top left corner of the app. - Tap ***设置 ***(gear icon) in the lower right of the app. - Tap ***Posting Schedule ***under "Scheduling." - Tap on a day of the week to adjust the posting times for that day. - From there, you can: - **Add a new posting time**: tap the blue Add a posting time link at the bottom of the screen, then select the time you want to add and tap Use this time. - **Remove a posting time**: tap the one you want to remove and tap Remove. - **Disable a posting day: **tap the toggle at the top of the screen to turn OFF posting for that day. It will be blue (enabled) by default). - Once you're happy with the changes you've made, tap ***Save ***in the upper right corner of the screen to save your changes. ## Creating and schedule a post With your channel(s) connected and your posting schedule and timezone set, you're ready to create your first post! Let's create a simple post with text and an image to get started. - Tap the blue + icon at the bottom middle of your screen to open the composer. On **Android**, tap the ***blue pencil icon*** at the bottom right of your screen to open the composer. - The social channel you just connected will already be selected. - Type or paste the caption of your post. - Tap ***Add Attachment*** to add an image to your post. You'll have various options for adding media attachments. On **iOS**, you can tap the ***camera icon*** to add an image from your phone. On **Android, **you can tap *Select from photo gallery *([screenshot](https://share.aitoearn.com/L1uXjDQL)). - Once the image is uploaded, you can tap **Edit Image **if you'd like to crop your image or tap **Add description **to add alt-text ([if it's supported on the channel you're posting to](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/630-adding-alt-text-to-your-images-on-the-aitoearn-mobile-app)). - When your post is complete, tap ***Done*** and then tap ***Next***. - From here, choose ***Add to Queue ***and your post will get scheduled for the next available time slot, based on the posting schedule you created a few moments ago.
