Every feature 那个 exists on legacy plans is also 可用 on one of 我们的 new plans with the exception of Posting Groups. 📝 **Note: ** - If 您 currently have posting groups created in 您的 账户, they 应该 remain once 您 switch over to 我们的 new plans. - If 您 do not have posting groups set up yet, 您 可以 创建 a posting group before switching to 我们的 new plans. 这个 将会 allow 您 to keep the feature on 您的 账户 after migrating to 我们的 new plans. ### 可以 I try it out ahead of time?
