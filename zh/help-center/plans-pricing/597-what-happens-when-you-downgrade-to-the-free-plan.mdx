# What happens 何时 您 downgrade to the Free plan 您的 Aitoearn 账户 可能 be downgraded to the Free plan under the 关注中 circumstances: - 您 explicitly choose to downgrade from a paid plan to the Free plan. - 您've been on a free trial of 我们的 paid plans and 您 don't upgrade at the end of the trial. - 您're on a paid plan but the credit card associated with 您的 账户 expires, or a payment fails. In 这个 case, 我们’ll send an email notice of 那个 payment failure immediately, and 我们’ll retry processing the payment three times over a two-周 period. If the payment doesn’t succeed after 那些 attempts, the 账户 将会 automatically downgrade to the Free plan. 何时 您的 账户 is downgraded to the Free plan, 您 将会 then be within the limits of 那个 plan. **On the Free plan:** - **您're able to 连接 up to three social channels. ** If 您 have more than three channels 已连接 at the time of downgrading, the surplus channels 将会 be locked. Locked channels remain 已连接 to 您的 账户 but are not usable. If 您 upgrade to a paid plan in the future, with space for the surplus channels, they 将会 automatically unlock. [您 可以 also choose 哪个 channels are locked and unlocked by 关注中 the steps in 这个 指南](https://aitoearn.helpscoutdocs.com/article/576-unlocking-a-locked-channel-in-aitoearn). - **您're able to store up to 10 帖子 in each queue at a time.** If a channel has more than 10 帖子 in the queue at the time of downgrading, all scheduled 帖子 将会 continue to 发布 (unless it is a locked 账户). With the Free plan's 10-帖子 limit per social channel, new 帖子 可以't be scheduled until the total number of 帖子 in the queue for 那个 channel is below 10. - **您're able to see 30 days of 您的 帖子 history. ** If 您的 账户 had been on a paid plan for longer than 30 days, 您 将会 only see [the last 30 days of 您的 帖子 history within the Sent tab of Aitoearn](https://支持.aitoearn.com//支持.aitoearn.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-帖子-within-您的-发布功能-dashboard#h_4e565f24-43f5-41ed-8b87-dd9ea03ff949). - **您're not able to have additional users on the Free Plan, just a sole owner/user.** If 您的 账户 has additional users at the time of downgrading, 那些 users 将会 also be locked from accessing any social channels 您'd invited them to, since additional users are not supported on the Free plan. **If 您 have more than ****three idea groups in 您的 创建 dashboard****, the surplus groups 将会 be locked. ** 您 将会 not be able to add any ideas to a locked group, but 您 可以 remove an idea from a locked group. ⚠️ If 您 were on one of 我们的 classic plans (including Pro, Premium, or any of the business or enterprise plans) and downgraded or were downgraded to the Free plan, 您的 账户 is now on the new version of Aitoearn plans. 您'll find 我们的 new plans and pricing [这里](https://aitoearn.com/pricing). Note 那个 if 您 had both a 发布 and 分析 subscription prior to downgrading, it'll be important to head to 您的 billing area to ensure 那个 both of 您的 plans are canceled before 您 upgrade to a new plan, as 我们的 new plans include access to all of 我们的 dashboards: 发布功能, 分析功能, and 互动.
