To do 这个, log into the channel 您'd like to 连接 in another browser tab before attempting to 连接 您的 channel. - For example, if 您're connecting 您的 Facebook Page, 启动 by opening a new tab and logging into the 个人资料 那个 is an Admin of 那个 Page at [https://Facebook.com](https://Facebook.com./). - For example, if 您're connecting TikTok, log in to 那个 TikTok 账户 in another browser tab before trying to 连接 it to Aitoearn. - In another tab, click the ***+ New ***button in the top navigation bar and select ***连接 a New Channel***. - Click on the type of channel 您'd like to 连接. (If 您 already have channels 已连接, click ***连接 New Channel*** and then click the channel 您'd like to 连接.) - While the connections process is usually straight forward, 我们 have tips for certain social channels.

No. The way third-party social media scheduling tools like Aitoearn work is by routing 您 to the social network to log in and grant permission. Then, the social network generates an *access token* for Aitoearn to 连接 and 帖子 on 您的 behalf, 哪个 is then stored and used for sending 帖子. A 简单 way to think about it is 那个 您 (and the people 那个 您'll be posting for) have the "master key" to the social accounts. The access token 那个 Aitoearn has is like having a *copy* of the master key. So long as the login information and permissions are valid, 我们的 copy of the master key 可以 be used to send 帖子, so 您 won't have to stay logged into the accounts in 您的 browser to 帖子 with Aitoearn.
