At 这个 time, channel groups 您 创建 are only 可用 to 您. They 将会 not be visible to 您的 team and are not able to be shared with others. ### 为什么 is my new channel group showing up empty? A channel group 可能 appear empty if the selected channels are no longer accessible to 您. 这个 可以 happen if: - 您 added a channel 那个 您 no longer have access to (for example, the Admin of 您的 organization removed 您的 access). - The channel was deleted by an organization admin. - The channel belonged to a different organization 那个 您 no longer belong to. To fix 这个, try re-adding 可用 channels to the group or, if 您're part of an organization, check with 您的 team's Admin to confirm current access permissions. ### 可以 I add the same channel to multiple groups? Yes, a single channel 可以 typically be included in more than one group.
