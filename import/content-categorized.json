To calculate the cost of your plan, you can check out <a href=\"http://buffer.com/pricing\" target=\"_blank\">our pricing calculator.</a></p>\n<h3>What counts as a channel?</h3>\n<p>Each social account you connect is a channel. For instance, a Facebook Page, Facebook Group, X/Twitter profile, Linked Page, and Linked Profile would count as 5 channels.</p>\n<h3>Do you offer a free trial of your plans?</h3>\n<p>Yes, we <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/549-information-about-free-trials\" target=\"_blank\">offer a free 14-day trial</a> so you can explore our paid features. If you start a free trial, you'll be placed on a trial of our Team plan, which includes access to our publishing, engagement, and analytics features. It also allows you to explore our paid features, including team functions such as inviting other users, setting up posting permissions, and draft/post approvals.</p>\n<h3>Plan and feature

This can result in the posts failing to send and your access token being revoked, causing you to need to refresh the account in Buffer. In some cases, Facebook may even suspend your account.</p>\n<p>There are some steps you can take in order to keep your accounts safe. When&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules\" target=\"_self\">setting up your posting schedules</a>, it's a good idea to make sure they're different from one another, even if the times are just a few minutes apart. For example, let's say you have five Facebook Pages and you'd like to publish a post to them every morning at around 9:30am. Rather than having a 9:30am slot in each posting schedule, we'd recommend something like:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>Page 1:</strong>&nbsp;9:30am</li>\n <li><strong>Page 2:</strong>&nbsp;9:34am</li>\n <li><strong>Page 3:</strong>&nbsp;9:39am</li>\n <li><strong>Page 4:</strong>&nbsp;9:42am</li>\n <li><strong>Page 5:</strong>&nbsp;9:47am</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When scheduling posts, we'd recommend using the&nbsp;<em><strong>Add to Queue</strong></em>&nbsp;option, which will save your post in the next available time slot from your posting schedule. This ensures that posts are sent out at the staggered times you've configured. If you use the&nbsp;<em><strong>Share Now</strong></em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em><strong>Schedule Post</strong></em>&nbsp;option when scheduling a post for multiple pages, all of the posts will be sent at exactly the same time, which increases the chances of Facebook perceiving this as spam or bot behavior, which could result in them flagging your account.</p>\n<p>Variations to the post can also help to greatly reduce the likelihood of Facebook flagging the accounts for spam. If you're planning to share a post to 100 Facebook Pages for example, instead of crafting one post and sending it to all 100 Pages, it's better to create four or five variations of the post.</p>\n<h2 id=\"FAQ-Jb_q_\">FAQ</h2>\n<h3>Are Facebook carousel posts supported?</h3>\n<p>At this time, we don't have a way to create a carousel post on Facebook.

They intend for personal profiles to be approached and treated as independent, personal accounts, where the content shared is authentic and created/shared by the owner of the profile.</p>\n<p>If the LinkedIn team notices that duplicate content is being shared to profiles, they will often suspend those accounts.

Then, the social network generates an <i>access token</i> for Buffer to connect and post on your behalf, which is then stored and used for sending posts.</p>\n<p>A simple way to think about it is that you (and the people that you'll be posting for) have the \"master key\" to the social accounts. The access token that Buffer has is like having a&nbsp;<i>copy</i>&nbsp;of the master key. So long as the login information and permissions are valid, our copy of the master key can be used to send posts, so you won't have to stay logged into the accounts in your browser to post with Buffer.</p>\n    </article>",

Through the process, you’ll add a bit of code to your website, which Facebook will search for in order to verify it on their side. Once it’s verified, you can associate your Facebook page with your verified domain so that Facebook knows it’s okay for that page to edit link previews from that website.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Please note, link preview customization is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;currently available for Facebook groups, regardless of Domain Verification.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_58113580-54e6-421e-8db9-af57e0821c44\">Who is Domain Verification for?</h2>\n<p>Domain Verification is for anyone who owns a website and wants to control the appearance of their link previews when they publish to Facebook. Without Domain Verification, you will not be able to customize the thumbnail image, or edit the title or link description when sharing links from your own website. Follow the steps below to set up Domain Verification for your site. This is not the easiest or quickest process, so we recommend grabbing a coffee!</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_35ceb681-a449-46fb-a7f8-d3b4826669b4\">Setting up Domain Verification</h2>\n<h3>Step 1 - Adding your domain to Meta Business Suite</h3>\n<ol>\n <li>Open&nbsp;<a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Business Suite</a>.</li>\n <li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Business Settings</strong>.</li>\n <li>Click on&nbsp;<strong><em>Brand Safety</em></strong>&nbsp;in the left side panel and then choose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/settings/owned-domains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domains</a>.</li>\n <li>Click on&nbsp;<em><strong>Add</strong></em>&nbsp;and enter your domain in the pop-up.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 2 - Verifying your domain</h3>\n<p>There are two methods to verify your Facebook page - DNS Verification and HTML file upload - both described below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DNS-Verification-EBonm\">DNS verification</h3>\n<p>If you choose this method, you’ll need to upload a .txt file to your webhost.</p>\n<ol>\n <li>First, you’ll need to grab the TXT record from Facebook Business Manager. You can do this by clicking on the&nbsp;<strong><em>DNS Verification</em></strong>&nbsp;tab.</li>\n <li>Next, log into your domain provider account and head over to the DNS records section.</li>\n <li>Add the TXT entry that you copied from Facebook, to your DNS record. Please note, some domain hosts may require you to add @ to the host field. Below you'll find steps to do this in some of the common DNS providers.\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"https://ca.godaddy.com/help/add-a-txt-record-19232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoDaddy</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217282457-How-to-Edit-DNS-records-A-AAAA-CNAME-MX-TXT-SRV-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hover</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/559\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BlueHost</a></li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>Once the changes have propagated across your domain's web servers, click the&nbsp;<strong><em>Verify</em></strong>&nbsp;button at the bottom of the&nbsp;<strong><em>DNS Verification</em></strong>&nbsp;tab in Facebook, for the selected domain. Typically, this change only takes a few minutes to occur, but there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.

You'll then be prompted to check if you’re posting to the correct account. If you’re unsure, tap&nbsp;<em><strong>See who is logged on</strong></em>. This will take you to the Instagram app where you can check which account you’re currently using.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499dc556a3e3cf18cc027/img-1714411-1695848922-1561476440.png\" alt=\"Buffer mobile app Instagram reminder\" style=\"width: 293.993px; \"></p>\n<p>Instagram allows you to connect five accounts per device, meaning you can easily switch between them without logging in and out each time. Once in Instagram, head to your profile and if you’re logged into multiple accounts you’ll be able to switch between them by tapping the account name at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Once you have the right account selected, head back to the Buffer app and share your post as normal (you can do this by clicking&nbsp;<em><strong>&lt; Buffer</strong></em>&nbsp;at the top left of the screen).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Managing-more-than-five-Instagram-accounts-kE_O6\">Managing more than five Instagram accounts</h2>\n<p>Instagram has a limit of five active accounts per device, which means if you’re managing more than that, you will need to fully log out of each account and log back into the correct one that the post is intended for. One thing to note is that you would need to make sure Instagram is not \"remembering\" the login details for each account, otherwise it wouldn't let you login to a sixth account.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p><b>Note: </b>Constantly logging in and out of accounts, especially if it's from different IP addresses, can lead to Instagram raising security flags on these accounts, since this can be interpreted as suspicious activity. This can then result in frequently needing to reconnect your Instagram accounts to Buffer. We appreciate that this is time consuming and frustrating, and for this reason, we do not recommend managing more than five Instagram accounts if you’re likely to use notification publishing on a regular basis, as it’s very likely to lead to these types of issues.</p>\n</div>\n    </article>",

Then, the social network generates an <i>access token</i> for Buffer to connect and post on your behalf, which is then stored and used for sending posts.</p>\n<p>A simple way to think about it is that you (and the people that you'll be posting for) have the \"master key\" to the social accounts. The access token that Buffer has is like having a&nbsp;<i>copy</i>&nbsp;of the master key. So long as the login information and permissions are valid, our copy of the master key can be used to send posts, so you won't have to stay logged into the accounts in your browser to post with Buffer.</p>\n    </article>",

Through the process, you’ll add a bit of code to your website, which Facebook will search for in order to verify it on their side. Once it’s verified, you can associate your Facebook page with your verified domain so that Facebook knows it’s okay for that page to edit link previews from that website.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Please note, link preview customization is&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;currently available for Facebook groups, regardless of Domain Verification.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_58113580-54e6-421e-8db9-af57e0821c44\">Who is Domain Verification for?</h2>\n<p>Domain Verification is for anyone who owns a website and wants to control the appearance of their link previews when they publish to Facebook. Without Domain Verification, you will not be able to customize the thumbnail image, or edit the title or link description when sharing links from your own website. Follow the steps below to set up Domain Verification for your site. This is not the easiest or quickest process, so we recommend grabbing a coffee!</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_35ceb681-a449-46fb-a7f8-d3b4826669b4\">Setting up Domain Verification</h2>\n<h3>Step 1 - Adding your domain to Meta Business Suite</h3>\n<ol>\n <li>Open&nbsp;<a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meta Business Suite</a>.</li>\n <li>Click on&nbsp;<strong>Business Settings</strong>.</li>\n <li>Click on&nbsp;<strong><em>Brand Safety</em></strong>&nbsp;in the left side panel and then choose&nbsp;<a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/settings/owned-domains\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domains</a>.</li>\n <li>Click on&nbsp;<em><strong>Add</strong></em>&nbsp;and enter your domain in the pop-up.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Step 2 - Verifying your domain</h3>\n<p>There are two methods to verify your Facebook page - DNS Verification and HTML file upload - both described below.</p>\n<h3 id=\"DNS-Verification-EBonm\">DNS verification</h3>\n<p>If you choose this method, you’ll need to upload a .txt file to your webhost.</p>\n<ol>\n <li>First, you’ll need to grab the TXT record from Facebook Business Manager. You can do this by clicking on the&nbsp;<strong><em>DNS Verification</em></strong>&nbsp;tab.</li>\n <li>Next, log into your domain provider account and head over to the DNS records section.</li>\n <li>Add the TXT entry that you copied from Facebook, to your DNS record. Please note, some domain hosts may require you to add @ to the host field. Below you'll find steps to do this in some of the common DNS providers.\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"https://ca.godaddy.com/help/add-a-txt-record-19232\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">GoDaddy</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://help.hover.com/hc/en-us/articles/217282457-How-to-Edit-DNS-records-A-AAAA-CNAME-MX-TXT-SRV-\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hover</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://my.bluehost.com/hosting/help/559\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">BlueHost</a></li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>Once the changes have propagated across your domain's web servers, click the&nbsp;<strong><em>Verify</em></strong>&nbsp;button at the bottom of the&nbsp;<strong><em>DNS Verification</em></strong>&nbsp;tab in Facebook, for the selected domain. Typically, this change only takes a few minutes to occur, but there are cases where it may take up to 72 hours.

You'll then be prompted to check if you’re posting to the correct account. If you’re unsure, tap&nbsp;<em><strong>See who is logged on</strong></em>. This will take you to the Instagram app where you can check which account you’re currently using.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499dc556a3e3cf18cc027/img-1714411-1695848922-1561476440.png\" alt=\"Buffer mobile app Instagram reminder\" style=\"width: 293.993px; \"></p>\n<p>Instagram allows you to connect five accounts per device, meaning you can easily switch between them without logging in and out each time. Once in Instagram, head to your profile and if you’re logged into multiple accounts you’ll be able to switch between them by tapping the account name at the top of the screen.</p>\n<p>Once you have the right account selected, head back to the Buffer app and share your post as normal (you can do this by clicking&nbsp;<em><strong>&lt; Buffer</strong></em>&nbsp;at the top left of the screen).</p>\n<h2 id=\"Managing-more-than-five-Instagram-accounts-kE_O6\">Managing more than five Instagram accounts</h2>\n<p>Instagram has a limit of five active accounts per device, which means if you’re managing more than that, you will need to fully log out of each account and log back into the correct one that the post is intended for. One thing to note is that you would need to make sure Instagram is not \"remembering\" the login details for each account, otherwise it wouldn't let you login to a sixth account.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p><b>Note: </b>Constantly logging in and out of accounts, especially if it's from different IP addresses, can lead to Instagram raising security flags on these accounts, since this can be interpreted as suspicious activity. This can then result in frequently needing to reconnect your Instagram accounts to Buffer. We appreciate that this is time consuming and frustrating, and for this reason, we do not recommend managing more than five Instagram accounts if you’re likely to use notification publishing on a regular basis, as it’s very likely to lead to these types of issues.</p>\n</div>\n    </article>",

Here are some common scenarios to check:</p>\n<h4>1. The profile isn’t following your LinkedIn organization page</h4>\n<p>For a tag to work, the person you're trying to mention must be following your company’s LinkedIn page.</p>\n<p><strong>How to verify:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n <li>As the Page Admin, go to your company page, click on the number of followers, and search for the name of the person you're trying to mention.</li>\n <li>Alternatively, the person you're trying to mention can verify if they're following your page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>2. The profile has profile visibility turned off</h4>\n<p>If someone has restricted their profile visibility, they may not appear as an option to mention when you're composing a post.</p>\n<h4>3. Third-party data sharing is turned off</h4>\n<p>LinkedIn allows users to limit how their data is shared with external tools and services. If this setting is disabled, it can prevent them from being mentioned outside of LinkedIn directly.</p>\n<h4>4. Mentions are disabled on their account</h4>\n<p>LinkedIn users can choose to prevent others from mentioning them in posts or comments. If this setting is off, they won’t be taggable.</p>\n<h4>5. The profile has restricted access to their profile</h4>\n<p>If the person you’re trying to tag has blocked you or set their profile visibility so you can’t view it, you won’t be able to tag them.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p><b>Note: </b>Items 2-5 in the above list can only be verified by the LinkedIn profile owner within their account settings. Therefore, if you've confirmed that the profile is following your Page, you can ask the profile owner to check the following:</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>If there is any missing piece of information about the profile being tagged, including First Name, Last Name, or Headline.</li>\n  <li>If you are trying to match a profile you want to tag based on the Maiden Name or Additional Name, that information is not publicly visible.</li>\n  <li>In case there are any misspelled characters, hidden spaces in the name, etc.</li>\n  <li>&nbsp;If the user’s profile you are tagging is not in EN_US, it won’t be returned under suggestions.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GQ2HMQSYS1TJJ8CCMEJRPS1N\">Mastodon mentions</h2>\n<p>You can mention users by typing out their full address, e.g. @jane@exampleserver.com.</p>\n<p>Note that any usage of @word will be interpreted as mentioning the local user with the username word, if that user exists.</p>\n<p>Only the username part will count against your character limit – the domain is not counted.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GYWBJ4H03NR7KD4X0EDZ01TZ\">TikTok mentions</h2>\n<p>You can mention a TikTok user by typing out their exact handle in the caption of your post (e.g. @‌bufferapp). Once published to TikTok, the account you mentioned will become hyperlinked.&nbsp;</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GYWBJ4H03NR7KD4X0EDZ01TZ\">Threads mentions</h2>\n<p>At this time, we’re not able to autocomplete mentions of Threads or Instagram accounts. That said, you can still include mentions in your Threads post but you would need to type in the exact handle you’d like to include. Once published, the mention should be hyperlinked.</p>\n<h2 id=\"Bluesky-mentions-available-through-our-beta-program-lCsAl\">Bluesky mentions</h2>\n<p>Tag other users by inputting their full handle, eg: @name.bsky.social. We don’t currently offer autocomplete of handles, so make sure to type the handle correctly, or copy/paste from their page!</p>\n    </article>",

Understanding your audience helps tailor the tone and style accordingly.&nbsp;</li>\n <li><strong>Content:</strong> Please provide the main idea you want to include in the post. It could be a specific message, a call-to-action, or any other specific details you'd like to share.</li>\n <li><strong>Keywords/Hashtags</strong>: Adding relevant keywords can improve visibility and engagement.</li>\n <li><strong>Tone and Style:</strong> How do you want your post to sound? For example, friendly, informative, formal, casual, etc.</li>\n <li><strong>CTA (Call-to-Action):</strong> If you want to direct the audience to a website, landing page, or any specific action, please provide the link or details in your prompt.</li>\n <li><strong>Platform:</strong> Which social media channel will this post be published on? Different platforms have different character limits and audience expectations. (Note: Buffer's AI assistant takes care of network customized prompts automatically once you've clicked <em><strong>Customize for each network </strong></em>in the composer)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GS8G3FKDMZZC5C0N9TM5716T\">Known limitations with AI</h2>\n<div>\n Buffer's AI Assistant currently utilizes GPT-4.0 technology from OpenAI to generate suggestions.

When people visit your Shop Grid link (likely from your Instagram bio), they'll be able to click on any of your post images to access the link you've connected that post to.\n</div>\n<div>\n Start Page&nbsp;is your own microsite with pictures, videos, links, and text (you can even add a button pointing to your Shop Grid!). You can use it as your one-and-only website, or you can use it for specific purposes, such as to promote a sales campaigns or share all of your donation opportunities. See how other customers use their Start Page&nbsp;here.\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"01EKAJ0T9WQQ837RFYB4ZH33K2\">Is Shop Grid the same as Instagram's product tagging feature?</h3>\n<p>Shop Grid is a Buffer feature rather than an Instagram feature. It is not the same as Instagram's product tagging feature. The posts displayed on your Instagram feed will not be clickable. They will only be clickable on the unique page that you can link within your bio.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01EKAJ0T9WM44PWDWSACSKVKB1\">How will multi-image posts display on my Shop Grid page?</h3>\n<p>Posts that include multiple images will be shown on your Shop Grid page (assuming you've added a link), but only the first image will be visible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01EKAJ0T9W2BHT5008T1NFVYYQ\">How will video posts display on my Shop Grid page?</h3>\n<p>Posts that include a video will be shown on your Shop Grid page (assuming you've added a link), but the video will be shown as a static image.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01EKAJ0T9W9Q7W8MRHYHAQGKWF\">Is it possible to track clicks on Shop Grid links?</h3>\n<p>We do not offer any tracking on Shop Grid links at the moment, but you can add UTM parameters to your links and then track them in Google Analytics. UTM&nbsp;parameters are tags that are added to the end of a URL, which help to track the effectiveness of a campaign, or more specifically in this context, the effectiveness of a link associated with an Instagram post that you publish. If you have hundreds or thousands of visitors to your website each month, it's helpful to know where that traffic is coming from.</p>\n<p>The UTM parameters that have been set, will then appear in Google Analytics as the links direct traffic to the particular website. This tracking can be found within the Acquisitions section of Google Analytics.</p>\n<p>Select&nbsp;<em><strong>Acquisitions</strong></em>&nbsp;on the left hand side and then click&nbsp;<em><strong>Campaigns</strong></em>, followed by&nbsp;<em><strong>All Campaigns</strong></em>. This is where you can track the different campaigns that have been created and the traffic that has been generated. You’ll see a list of all the campaigns you’ve been tracking and you can click on each to view the full details. You can filter for different Campaigns, Sources and Mediums, which have been added to the URLs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01EKAJ0T9XST51HXX4RB1DR1Y5\">What happens if I delete an image from my Instagram feed natively?</h3>\n<p>If an image is deleted from your Instagram feed natively, it would also delete from your Shop Grid page.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01EKAJ0T9XST51HXX4RB1DR1Y5\">What happens to my Shop Grid page if I remove my Instagram account from Buffer?</h3>\n<p>If you remove your Instagram account from Buffer, your Shop Grid page will also be deleted. If you (or someone else) visited the link, you would be redirected to the Shop Grid page on the Buffer website. If you were to reconnect your Instagram account later on, your Shop Grid page would be created again, with the same link, since the URL is \"https://shopgr.id/\" followed by your Instagram handle. However, you would need to add any links back to your posts.</p>\n<h3>Can I add links to my Instagram reels?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can add links to both image posts and reels within Shop Grid.</p>\n    </article>",

Rather than doing all of your content planning in a separate tool (like Trello or Excel), you can prepare all that content in Ideas. That way, it’s ready to be scheduled straight to your queue, saving you time. It’s also easy to use, with the browser extension, you can save ideas on the go.</p>\n<p>We’ve found using Ideas over another external tool to plan and prepare your content can save you up to 84 hours a year. That’s enough time to take a two week holiday! <a href=\"https://buffer.com/resources/introducing-ideas-creating-content-just-got-84-hours-faster/\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more about the great reasons you should use Ideas on our blog</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GFRXJG104C679CFRGW3BA18R\">Should I use Ideas or Drafts?</h2>\n<p>Drafts are great when you’re preparing content for a specific social media channel. You can load up that channel and prepare your draft.</p>\n<p>However, if you don’t know which channel you want to publish your content to, then using Ideas is encouraged.</p>\n<p>Ideas is channel agnostic. When first jotting down an idea, you don’t even need to know which social media channel/s you envision it later being published to.</p>\n<p>Once you’ve collected all of the details you need to turn that idea it into a post you’ll be proud of, you can graduate it from your Create area and schedule it within your live queue(s).</p>\n<p>In short, if you’re just coming up with an idea from scratch, but you’re not quite sure what you’ll write or where you’ll post, then use Ideas. If you’re later on in the content creation process and have your image, text, and social channels figured out, then use Drafts.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GFRYA38XQTQ0A1068BQHKJKW\">Creating ideas</h2>\n<p>To create a new idea:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>From the <i><b>Create </b></i>tab, click the <i><b>+ New </b></i>button at the top from anywhere in Buffer and select <i><b>Idea</b></i>.

Feeds refresh live, pulling directly from source websites.</p>\n<h3>How often do feeds refresh?</h3>\n<p>Feeds refresh automatically when you access them in Buffer, pulling the latest available articles.</p>\n<h3>How are 'Explore Feeds' chosen?</h3>\n<p>'Explore feeds' selected based on popularity and usefulness, manually curated by our team. There’s no automated recommendation at this time.</p>\n<h3>Why is my feed not loading or why is my feed showing errors?</h3>\n<p>Check the feed URL for accuracy or test it in an external RSS validator tool. Feeds must be RSS or Atom formats.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Here are a few resources to check the feed URL:\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"https://validator.w3.org/feed/\">https://validator.w3.org/feed/</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://getrssfeed.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://getrssfeed.com/</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://rssfinder.app/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://rssfinder.app/</a></li>\n  </ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Why isn’t a specific article showing in my feed?</h3>\n<p>Buffer displays exactly what the RSS source provides. If an article isn't appearing, it's typically because the site itself hasn't included it in their RSS.</p>\n    </article>",

To use automatic posting, images and videos must adhere to Instagram's accepted aspect ratio range.</p>\n<p>In this article:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><a href=\"#What-is-an-aspect-ratio-dEMQk\" target=\"_self\">What is an aspect ratio?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_01H9RQGFJC1JSCXADP3Y7NDJBF\" target=\"_self\">What are Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_01H9RQGFJCQJM8ATBKZKDP3K0Y\" target=\"_self\">How are aspect ratios calculated? </a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_01H9RQGFJCJNZ7MP64RW82QE5Q\" target=\"_self\">What sizes do my images and videos need to be?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#What-size-will-Buffer-display-my-images--GwEMp\">How will Buffer display my images? </a></li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout-red\">\n <p>If you upload an image that falls outside the accepted aspect ratio ranges, you can use our editing tool to crop the image! <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/614-editing-your-images-in-buffer#01FNV15FWRZGB0A29QZ5Y24A7F\">Here's more about editing your images in Buffer.&nbsp;</a></p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"What-is-an-aspect-ratio-dEMQk\">What is an aspect ratio?</h2>\n<p>An aspect ratio describes the ratio between the image's width and height. Aspect ratios are often represented as two numbers separated by a colon, e.g. 4:5. This can be a convenient way of displaying an aspect ratio and can be converted into a numerical value by dividing the first by the second. So, for example, an aspect ratio written as 4:5 has a value of 4/5 = 0.8.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9RQGFJC1JSCXADP3Y7NDJBF\">What are Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges?</h2>\n<p>The table below outlines the accepted aspect ratio ranges for both images and videos.</p>\n<table class=\"hs-table\">\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>&nbsp;</td>\n   <td><strong>Aspect ratio range&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></td>\n   <td><strong>Aspect ratio range as numerical values</strong></td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Images</strong></td>\n   <td>Between 4:5 and 1.91:1</td>\n   <td>Between 0.8 and 1.91</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Stories</strong></td>\n   <td>9:16 (suggested)</td>\n   <td>0.56&nbsp;</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Reels</strong></td>\n   <td><p>9:16 (recommended)*</p><p>*can accept between 0.01:1 and 10:1 but 9:16 is recommended to avoid cropping or blank spaces.</p></td>\n   <td>0.56&nbsp;</td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 If your image or video is within the accepted aspect ratio range, your post can be published automatically. If the aspect ratio of your image or video falls outside of the range, your post will be scheduled as a notification instead. If you like, you can adjust the aspect ratio and then re-upload your image or video. For example, if your image has an aspect ratio of 1:2, it would fall outside of the accepted ratio range, so you would need to adjust the aspect ratio to get it to publish automatically. (<a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/614-editing-your-images-in-buffer#01FM0M1ZSR9A5JPBRANRGT0KSF\">Learn how to crop your Instagram images in Buffer here</a>).</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9RQGFJCQJM8ATBKZKDP3K0Y\">How are aspect ratios calculated?</h2>\n<p>To calculate the aspect ratio of an image or video, you can take the resolution and divide the width by the height. Here are some examples:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>1200 x 1200 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/1200 = 1</li>\n <li>1200 x 1500 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/1500 = 0.8</li>\n <li>1200 x 629 pixels: Aspect ratio of 1200/629 = 1.907</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Instagram is strict about the aspect ratio being&nbsp;<em>exactly</em>&nbsp;within their accepted range. They will not consider rounding to the closest number! For example, 1200 x 628 pixels would correspond to an aspect ratio of 1.910828, which falls outside of the acceptable range.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01H9RQGFJCJNZ7MP64RW82QE5Q\">What sizes do my images and videos need to be?</h2>\n<p>Your images or videos don't need to be a specific pixel size, as long as the aspect ratio is within the acceptable range. Here are some example sizes that would work nicely.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Notes</p>\n <ul>\n  <li>All videos posted to Instagram are now posted as Reels.

Once you’ve logged into Bitly, you’ll need to go to <b><i>Settings</i></b> in the top right hand corner, and then click on the <b><i>Advanced</i></b> button.\n</div>\n<div>\n Under the <b><i>Branded Short Domain</i></b> header, select whether you’re using your short domain for personal or business use.

A DNS is what makes a browser point to a website, so this is where you’re telling your custom short domain to point to Bitly. To update your DNS information, you’ll need to go to the website where you registered your domain name.\n</div>\n<div>\n Updating your DNS is typically pretty simple and should be very similar to the instruction below, even if you don’t use Name.com. For Name.com customers, you would log into your Name.com account, click on your short URL, and then click on <b><i>Update DNS records</i></b>.\n</div>\n<div>\n You would then need to edit the A record for your site. You can do this by changing the IP address to 69.58.188.49. If there isn’t an existing A record, add a new one. Where you see host, you can either leave it blank or add an @ sign. Either option works because they do the same thing. It’s also important to note that you should only have one A record. If you have more than one A record, you should remove all of them that don’t point to Bitly’s 69.58.188.49 IP address.\n</div>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n <li><b>Verify your domain ownership</b></li>\n</ol>\n<div>\n Now that your A record has been added to your domain name you need to go back to the <b><i>Branding Domains Settings</i></b> on Bitly and click the <b><i>Verify</i></b> button.

If you prefer not to have the link displaying in the body of the post, you can remove it from the composer after the link preview has been generated.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514998df8eafb48f4e81359/img-1662243-1695848843-784652267.png\" alt=\"Buffer composer with LinkedIn and Facebook selected and an arrow pointing to the title within the link preview\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<p>For <b>Facebook</b>, though we pull from Open Graph data, the preview is ultimately determined by Facebook itself, meaning that they do not rely on the exact same preview that we display.</p>\n<p>For <b>X/Twitter</b>, they don't allow third party apps like Buffer to provide the link preview information; instead, they generate it based on the information they see on the URL.</p>\n<p>For <b>LinkedIn</b>, link previews can be customized, meaning you're able to modify the title, description, and image if you wish.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For <b>Mastodon</b>, link previews can appear differently based on the way a server/instance is set up (as part of that server's theme settings), and based on your followers viewing preference settings and device.

We'll give an overview here and then get more specific in each of the sections below.</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>File size:</strong>\n  <ul>\n   <li><i>100MB for Instagram</i></li>\n   <li><i>10GB for YouTube Shorts</i></li>\n   <li><i>40MB for Mastodon</i></li>\n   <li><i>up to 1GB for Facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn, Pinterest, TikTok, Threads</i></li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li><strong>File format:</strong>\n  <ul>\n   <li><em>X/Twitter, Pinterest, Facebook, and LinkedIn:</em> MP4, MOV, AVI, and M4V</li>\n   <li><em>TikTok</em>: The video file formats accepted are MOV, MP4, or WEBM.</li>\n   <li><em>Instagram and Threads</em>: MP4 and MOV</li>\n   <li><em>YouTube Shorts:</em> .mov, .mp4, .mpg, .mpeg, .avi, .WebM</li>\n  </ul></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The video you upload will be converted to MP4 encoded with H264, and a maximum resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels (HD). Larger files are likely to be compressed to ensure they can be posted to the social network, but quality loss should be minimal.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, we can't support Apple ProRes or raw camera formats like ARRI and RED.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HCZ16PY9S79H6K9F255CJDWB\">Why is my video taking a while to upload?</h3>\n<p>When a video file is uploaded, there are a few steps the file needs to go through, including checking the file to ensure it can be passed over through the API, having AWS (Amazon Web Services) transcode the file, and generating potential thumbnails. When generating thumbnails, we look for a different thumbnail every 15 seconds. This means that for a video that is 30 minutes long, we would try to generate at least 120 different images. This can be a key factor that affects the upload speed.</p>\n<p>Depending on the file size, the length of the video, and the connection speed, each of these things could take different lengths of time and determine how long the overall process takes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_038ca001-4c5c-4ae6-a773-92a9dedb22b1\">Choosing thumbnails and titles</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HCZ16PY9W8C5B7T91T67P23N\">Choosing a title for your video</h3>\n<p>For Facebook, once your video has finished uploading, you can edit the video title in the field below the video.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65a6e1b069979704a279a2c4/file-N9MHe5aoDp.jpg\" alt=\"Buffer Publishing Video Title for Facebook\" style=\"width: 471.988px; \"></p>\n<h3 id=\"Choosing-a-thumbnail-from-your-video-gT-D7\">Choosing a thumbnail from your video</h3>\n<p>At this time, we do not support uploading an image for your video thumbnail. However, for Instagram, TikTok, and Pinterest, you can choose a thumbnail from the video you've uploaded. By default, the first frame of the video (0 seconds) will be used as the thumbnail. If you'd like to change your thumbnail, you'll follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Once your video has finished uploading, click <em><strong>Edit Thumbnail</strong></em><em>,</em></li>\n <li>Drag the slider to the position in the video you'd like to use as the cover/thumbnail image.</li>\n <li>Click <em><strong>Save</strong></em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514999cf8eafb48f4e81360/img-1662243-1695848855-330537964.gif\" alt=\"GIF of changing a video thumbnail\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <h4 id=\"h_01HCZ16PY9NRKVQC71A9JC77N5\">📝 Good-to-Knows</h4>\n <ul>\n  <li>Thumbnails can only be edited for TikTok, Pinterest and Instagram posts, and Instagram Reels.</li>\n  <li>The \"Edit Thumbnail\" button will not show up if your post is scheduled as a notification or if you have <i><b>Enable Notifications by default</b></i> turned on within your Buffer Instagram Settings.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01HCZ16PY9Q25YK8AWZM0TA8WH\">How thumbnails and titles are used on each social network</h2>\n<p>Since videos appear and behave a little differently on each social network, the thumbnail and title you choose will only be used in certain places.</p>\n<table class=\"hs-table\">\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td><strong>Facebook</strong></td>\n   <td>Many Facebook users choose to auto-play videos (this is a Facebook setting toggled here: https://www.facebook.com/settings/?tab=media).

Therefore, if you include a link to a video within the composer, it will not be hyperlinked once published. Instead, it would be published as plain text. Users could copy and paste the link from the caption to a new browser window, which would take them to the video. Additionally, when scheduling a post for Instagram, you're required to upload either an image or a video. Therefore, after dropping the link into the composer, you'll still need to choose or upload an image to accompany it. For these reasons, this method is not commonly used. Instead, we would recommend using the upload option described above.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6514999ef8eafb48f4e81361/img-1662243-1695848857-2048088042.png\" alt=\"Instagram post with an image of the Buffer Stories Creator logo\" style=\"width: 304.991px; \"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_7c45d417-cb74-47eb-805e-b64040b46d6d\">How videos appear on X/Twitter</h2>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HCZ16PY95ZNH3YVFHNTTCPTQ\">Video upload</h3>\n<p>Videos appear natively once published to X/Twitter, if they are within <a href=\"https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-videos#FAQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X's/Twitter’s permitted file limits</a> of 512MB and between .5 seconds to 140 seconds long.

Posting through Buffer to a social network utilizes API services, which sometimes handle images differently than if you were to post natively on the social platform itself.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HCZ0JBRBPQX85WD2JWH1A6DY\">Image size requirements, formats, and automatic resizing</h3>\n<p>When uploading an image to Buffer, the image must be under 10MB. We currently support JPG, PNG and HEIC image files for all social networks, and additionally GIF files for X/Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram, Mastodon, and Pinterest.</p>\n<p>Additionally, each social network’s API service has its own image file size limit (which may be different than the native upload limit). If the image you upload is under 10MB, but larger than the limit for that social network, we'll convert it to a smaller size to ensure it can be published. Only one image attribute (width or height) will be adjusted and the other will scale automatically. This ensures that the original aspect ratio will be kept.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 After uploading your images, you can resize them within the Buffer composer by following this guide: <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/614-editing-your-images-in-buffer\" target=\"_self\">Editing your images in Buffer</a></p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Ideal-image-sizes-for-each-social-network-xPLf9\">Ideal image sizes for each social network</h2>\n<p>Each file size limit is listed under the social network below.

You can find guidance and more detail about aspect ratios here: <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/622-instagrams-accepted-aspect-ratio-ranges\" target=\"_self\">Instagram's accepted aspect ratio ranges</a>. If they fall outside of this aspect ratio, your post will be scheduled as a notification. Learn more in: <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/658-using-instagram-reminders\" target=\"_self\">Using notification based publishing for Instagram</a>.</li>\n  <li>If the image you upload is larger than 8MB, we'll convert it to a smaller size (1920 pixels wide) to ensure it can be published. The minimum dimensions accepted is 150 x 150 pixels. Smaller images will be scaled up to the minimum.</li>\n  <li>Instagram carousel posts can be square, horizontal, or vertical in format — and can include both photos and videos. However, once the first photo or video is selected, all of the following photos or videos selected will be cropped to the same aspect ratio. i.e. For example, if the first photo you select is square (1:1) all of your following content will be cropped to a 1:1 format. This is a Instagram Carousel limitation, and happens when posting natively on Instagram and when publishing via Buffer. The first photo sets the cropping standard for the rest.</li>\n  <li>If you want your image’s colors to look as true to the original as possible, it's important to save your images in the sRGB color profile, as this is the color profile that Instagram’s API supports. Please note that RGB is not the same as sRGB. Unfortunately, ProPhoto RGB color profile&nbsp;(the&nbsp;default color profile in Photoshop and Lightroom) is not supported by Instagram.&nbsp;</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<h4 id=\"h_01EWWYMBCY871G2TCR5XXF2S8Y\">X/Twitter</h4>\n<table class=\"hs-table\">\n <tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td>Supported file formats</td>\n   <td>JPG, PNG, GIF, WebP, HEIC</td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td>File size limit</td>\n   <td><p>5 MB for static image</p><p>15 MB for animated GIF</p></td>\n  </tr>\n </tbody>\n</table>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Even if an image is within the file size limit, we will check that the image is smaller than 8192 x 8192 pixels, since this is X/Twitter's maximum allowed dimension.

This image size should prevent cropping and scaling across formats.

This can cause some unexpected results if images are saved in certain ways, so we recommend using these tips if you are seeing distortion, pixelation, or slight color changes.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Save your file in PNG (.png) file format, rather than .jpg or other file formats.</li>\n <li>Avoid transparent backgrounds as they can cause distortion.</li>\n <li>If possible, save in sRGB color mode, as this is what is used by most browsers and social networks. Try to stay away from other color modes such as AdobeRBG/CMYK. Not saving in sRGB will result in a slight change of image colors when published.</li>\n <li>Avoid overly large dimensions for images. If the image needs to be resized by Buffer or the social platform, it could impact the quality of the image.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01EWWYRJRFHH1BAMD95D1HG96Q\">Troubleshooting image orientation issues</h2>\n<p>Sometimes, images might appear to be rotated once they have been published to your social channel. When images are uploaded to Buffer, we use the orientation data that is hard-coded in the background of the image based on how it was taken or the tool used to process it. This background information is called the EXIF data. Whilst the image may appear to be the correct orientation when previewing it on your computer, or in the composer after uploading it in Publish, it might be rotated once published.</p>\n<p>If this is happening for you, we thought we'd share <a href=\"https://www.thexifer.net/#exif-general\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this tool</a> that can remove the EXIF data from images before uploading them. Upload your image and then click <em><strong>eXif.me</strong></em>. Check the box to the right of \"EXIF Cleaner\" that says \"IF CHECKED ALL THE TAGS WILL BE CLEARED\" and then click <em><strong>Go.eXifing</strong></em>. This will remove the EXIF data from your image and then you can download the image by clicking \"Download.me\".</p>\n    </article>",

This view allows you to filter your scheduled posts by channel and tag. Learn more about <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/861-how-to-use-the-all-channels-view-in-buffer\">How to use the All Channels view in Buffer here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How can I delete or edit a published post?</h3>\n<p>At this time, we are unable to edit or delete a post once it's been published through Buffer. Instead, you'll need to edit or delete the published post directly on the social network. You can find a history of your published posts <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/517-insights-on-shared-posts-within-your-publishing-dashboard\">within the Sent tab of the Publish dashboard</a>.</p>\n<h3>Can I share evergreen content with Buffer?</h3>\n<p>At this time, it is not possible to create a post once and have it repeat indefinitely. However, you can use <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/660-share-posts-with-the-share-again-feature\" target=\"_blank\">our Duplicate feature to repeat a post</a>.</p>\n<h3>Do you support bulk scheduling? Can I upload my posts in bulk? Can I import my posts in bulk?</h3>\n<p>Yes, you can upload your posts in bulk with Buffer. <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/926-how-to-upload-posts-in-bulk-to-buffer\">Learn more about how bulk uploads work in Buffer here</a>.</p>\n<h3>How do I schedule a post for multiple channels?</h3>\n<p>In the composer, choose the channels you want to post to by selecting them individually (selected channels will appear in color).</p>\n<p>If you frequently post to the same set of channels, you can also create a <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/927-using-channel-groups-in-buffer\">channel group</a> to easily select multiple channels at once.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6877cd91522f451361e7f597/file-oUpI3vykpS.gif\" alt=\"GIF of selecting multiple channels in the Buffer composer\" style=\"width: 561px; \"></p>\n<h3>Can I group channels together when scheduling posts?</h3>\n<p>Yes! You can use <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/927-using-channel-groups-in-buffer\">channel groups</a> to organize multiple social media channels and schedule posts to them at once. This is especially helpful if you frequently post the same content across several platforms or manage multiple brand accounts.</p>\n<h3>I've created a post for multiple channels and need to edit my post. Can I edit scheduled posts in bulk?</h3>\n<p>At this time, we don't have a way to edit posts in bulk. If you're creating the same post for multiple channels, once it's been scheduled, we consider each post to be its own separate post. Therefore, you'll have to edit each post separately. If you'd like to see us support bulk editing in the future, <a href=\"https://suggestions.buffer.com/p/bulk-editing-of-posts\">you can upvote this idea on our suggestions board</a>.</p>\n<h3>Can I use Buffer to auto-repost or auto-share to channels not connected to Buffer?</h3>\n<p>No. We are not able to automatically repost content for you. The <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/653-buffer-browser-extension\">Buffer extension</a> allows you to select individual X/Twitter posts to repost (retweet), but it is not automatic.</p>\n<p>Buffer can only publish to channels that are connected to Buffer and have been selected in the composer when you create your post. Once your content is posted through Buffer, it will not be automatically posted to other social networks, even if you have settings enabled to allow this to happen when posting natively.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>For example, Instagram posts sent through Buffer will not automatically publish to Facebook, even if the setting is turned on within the Instagram app. This is due to API limitations. To publish a post to both Instagram and Facebook, both channels will need to be connected to Buffer and you will need to select both channels in the composer when you create your post.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Are there tools to help me consistently schedule and publish posts using Buffer?</h3>\n<p>Yes! Our<a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/907-understanding-streaks-in-buffer\" target=\"_blank\"> streaks feature</a> tracks how many weeks you've consistently published content through Buffer. Keep your streak going by publishing content each week and watch the number grow.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/912-setting-posting-goals-in-buffer\">create posting goals</a> for the number of times you'd like to post per channel per week. You can easily track your goal progress right from the channel's queue.</p>\n<h3>Can I use custom fonts or formatted text in my scheduled posts?</h3>\n<p>Buffer does not have a formatting text option within our composer. To add rich text or formatted text to your scheduled posts, you can use an online text formatting tool such as <a href=\"https://yaytext.com\" target=\"_blank\">YayText</a> to format your text and then paste it into the Buffer composer and schedule your post.</p>\n    </article>",

To hide the number of likes on your post, you can view the published post on Instagram and use the <i><b>Hide Likes</b></i> feature on the post.</p>\n<h3>Will Instagram posts sent through Buffer be automatically published to Facebook if I have this setting enabled within Instagram?</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, due to API limitations, Instagram posts that are published through Buffer will not automatically publish to Facebook, even if this setting is enabled on your Instagram account. To have an Instagram post automatically publish to Facebook, you would need to create the post directly on Instagram.</p>\n<h3>Is it possible to move the position of my text or change the font of my Instagram story or reel?</h3>\n<p>No, it is not possible to move the position of your Instagram text or change the font in Buffer. Due to API limitations, Buffer does not support editing the font or moving the text on the screen for Instagram Reels directly within the app. The preview you see in Buffer is just a guideline so you have an idea of what your text&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>look like.</p>\n<p>To customize the font and position of your text, you'll need to do so within the Instagram app itself. You can schedule your Reel with Buffer using the&nbsp;<i><b>Notify Me</b></i>&nbsp;option, and when it's time to post, you'll receive a notification on your phone. You can then open Instagram and add your text, choosing the font and positioning it as you like.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039027053\">Using notification based publishing for Instagram guide</a> for a walk-through of how to finish publishing your post once the notification comes to your phone).</p>\n</div>\n    </article>",

We know that quite a few of you are looking for this type of functionality. Unfortunately, this is not something that our tool offers, and we'd love to share some of the reasons why.</p>\n<p>This article contains the following sections:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><a href=\"#h_01FBTCSSNBWY6H9PTF1AT9KDFE\" target=\"_self\">How the social networks view duplicate content</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_01FBTCSZXR59CTH0EJW8NP1S4E\" target=\"_self\">What are the exact limitations when it comes to repeating the same content?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_01FBTCT5MD2R8KRJS8NKH446Q9\" target=\"_self\">What is the best way to share content more than once using Buffer?</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBTCSSNBWY6H9PTF1AT9KDFE\">How the social networks view duplicate content</h2>\n<p>A great social media marketing strategy can absolutely include <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/blog-strategies\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">refreshing and repurposing content</a>, but duplicating the exact same message is generally discouraged, and most social networks have a section in their guidelines or terms of service about what constitutes as spam.</p>\n<p>For example, in February 2018, X/Twitter <a href=\"https://blog.twitter.com/developer/en_us/topics/tips/2018/automation-and-the-use-of-multiple-accounts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced new guidelines</a> to prevent people from misusing multiple X/Twitter accounts to artificially amplify a message.</p>\n<p>We have built our scheduling based on advice from each social network that we're partnered with, and will always strive to maintain strong relationships with each one, by adhering to their policies and building a platform that supports the overall goals of the social media ecosystem.</p>\n<p>One of our key goals with the platform we're building, is to give users a greater voice on social media and enable them to share authentic content.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBTCSZXR59CTH0EJW8NP1S4E\">What are the exact limitations when it comes to repeating the same content?</h2>\n<p>Each post in your queue will only be published once. If you need to share a post multiple times, then you would need to create it multiple times within the queue. However, there are some limitations in terms of duplicating the same content. The exact limitations are:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>You will not be able to create the exact same post more than once within a 24 hour period.</li>\n <li>With <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/561-using-twitter-with-buffer#h_01H6SJ579KHBTCNRKRVSNXMVWV\" target=\"_self\">X's/Twitter's more explicit guidelines</a>, you will not be able to schedule a post for multiple X/Twitter accounts at the same time. In addition, you will not be able to use the Duplicate feature for X/Twitter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBTCT5MD2R8KRJS8NKH446Q9\">What is the best way to share content more than once using Buffer?</h2>\n<p>With so much content on social media now, posts can easily get missed and lost in the flow, and we understand that you need to get maximum visibility. We do not discourage reusing the actual content being shared (e.g. product links, blog posts, etc), but where we can, we do not allow the exact same message to be shared repeatedly.</p>\n<ol>\n <li>One option is to create separate posts in your queue, but make sure they are well spaced out and ideally using different text and/or media.</li>\n <li>Another option is to use the <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/660-share-posts-with-the-share-again-feature\" target=\"_blank\">Duplicate feature</a> within the Posts report to re-share a specific post after it's been published. We strongly encourage you to modify the post itself (text, image, video, etc.) before adding it back to your queue.</li>\n</ol>\n    </article>",

The drafts area is great for crafting ideas for posts, as well as creating final posts that you'd like to submit for approval. The option to request approval on drafts, as well as the ability to approve draft posts, will depend on permissions.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts\" target=\"_blank\">Learn more on how to create and approve draft posts here</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"01F65JGXB23XD5E1YP9RA5EQDQ\">Viewing metrics and working with reports in the analytics dashboard</h4>\n<p>All users can view metrics in the dashboards.

If this is the first time you’ve used Buffer’s analytics tool, we recommend visiting our guide to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/602-getting-started-with-buffers-analytics-features\" target=\"_blank\">Getting started with Buffer's analytics features</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"01F65JGXB2SXE6KW09ZVZJ185J\">Engaging with Instagram and Facebook comments</h4>\n<p>Team members with <b>Full Posting access</b> for an Instagram business account or Facebook Page within your Buffer organization can respond to the comments that come into that social channel.</p>\n<p>If you or another user in your Buffer organization has <b>Approval Required access</b> for an Instagram business account or a Facebook Page within your Buffer organization, they will not be able to access or respond to the comments that come through to that account.</p>\n<h4 id=\"01F8XC34FGJ0EC2QPGK7ZYMWD5\">Connecting or refreshing channels</h4>\n<p>If you have admin access via the social network itself, you can connect and refresh (reconnect) channels within the organization.

You can <a href=\"#h_01F65J9MQRY276VPK78N4ETXMR\">switch organizations</a> in the account menu as shown above.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/572-connecting-or-refreshing-channels-as-a-user-of-an-organization\" target=\"_self\">Follow this guide to learn more about connecting and refreshing channels</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 As an Admin, once you connect a social channel, you will have Full Posting Access to it.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n<p>If you notice that some of the channels you have access to have been locked, this is likely because the owner of the organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/597-what-happens-when-you-downgrade-to-the-free-plan\" target=\"_self\">downgraded their account</a>.

You can surprise them by creating a beautiful landing page that features their most important links and calls to action.

Click here to learn more about the hashtag manager feature: <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/586-how-hashtags-work-in-buffer#01G23C6K7CBG2Q20R1B36QB3PK\" target=\"_self\">Using Buffer's hashtag manager</a>.</li>\n <li><strong>Engagement dashboard:</strong> It can take hours to get through comments for multiple clients.

So, which plan will be best for you?</p>\n<ul>\n <li>If you need access for only one user, we recommend the <strong>Essentials </strong>plan.</li>\n <li>If you have one or more people collaborating with you in Buffer and/or are looking for exportable, self-branded reports, our <strong>Team plan</strong> would be the best choice.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/595-features-available-on-each-buffer-plan\" target=\"_self\"><strong>Learn more about our plans and pricing here</strong></a>.</p>\n<p><strong>What counts as a channel?</strong> A channel is each individual Page, group, or profile that you’d like to connect. As an example, you might be scheduling posts for 10 clients who each have five social channels (e.g. Facebook Page, Instagram account, 2 LinkedIn Pages, and Pinterest profile). This would come to 50 channels in total.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01G23EFJ411PTP700D1D6PSXED\">Connecting your clients' channels</h2>\n<p>There are two ways you can get your clients’ social channels set up in Buffer:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>You (the account owner) can connect them, or</li>\n <li>Your client can connect them if they are designated as an Admin on your Buffer account.

There are several considerations and reasons for these recommendations, which you can read in our <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/553-instagram-best-practices\" target=\"_self\">Instagram best practices</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01GEMSJN2QKHJRAAPSF1BBR2XY\">Option 2: Your client connects each of their social channels</h3>\n<p>While it’s possible for users on your account that are designated with the Admin permission to connect their own social channels, <b>there are two important considerations to keep in mind if you decide to go this route:</b></p>\n<ol>\n <li>Admins have the ability to manage any social channel connected to your Buffer organization.</li>\n <li>Admins will be able to access the billing settings on the billing page (<a href=\"https://account.buffer.com/billing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer nofollow\">https://account.buffer.com/billing</a>).</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout-red\">\n <p>If the other social channels connected to your Buffer organization are confidential (such as if you have many clients and don’t want each to have access to one another’s social channels), or you do not want your client to have access to the billing page of your account, you’ll want to move forward with <a href=\"#01GEMSJN2Q3EHTHXSQ5G08G7K5\">the first option to connect social channels explained above</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01G23EFRWDEV9WWA1CHWY1EMYS\">Giving your clients and staff the right permission levels</h2>\n<p>There are four main permissions available on your Buffer plan:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Organization owner/Account owner</li>\n <li>Admin</li>\n <li>Full posting access (channel specific)</li>\n <li>Approval required access (channel specific)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let’s talk about when using each might be most advantageous. To see a broader explanation of all of these permissions, head to the article: <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/670-adding-users-and-setting-up-permissions-in-your-organization\" target=\"_self\">Adding users and setting up permissions in your organization</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Organization owner:</strong></p>\n<p>The person who has access to the email address and password that the billing is under is the organization owner. There isn’t a way to designate a second owner, but we can transfer ownership to another Buffer user if needed.</p>\n<p>The organization owner will always have Full Posting access on all channels and this cannot be changed. You can read more about Full Posting access below.</p>\n<p>If you as the organization owner need to submit posts for approval to a client, you might consider creating a different Buffer account with a different email address and invite that user to have Admin access of the organization, but Approval Required access on the social channels you’ll need to submit for approval. With this solution, you will need to login under your owner account to access your billing information, but you should be able to do most other tasks via your new user account, such as create posts, manage users, customize posting schedules, and connect new channels (just make sure to select the correct organization).</p>\n<p><strong>Admin:</strong></p>\n<p>This permission affects access to your entire Buffer organization. You’ll give admin permission to anyone on your team who you’d like to have a full range of access, including connecting and removing social channels, creating and printing reports, viewing posting tag success, replying to all incoming Facebook and Instagram comments, and posting to all social channels connected to your Buffer account.</p>\n<p><strong>Full Posting access:</strong></p>\n<p>This permission affects access to individual social channels. Many agencies set their clients up with Full Posting access on one or more of their social channels. This allows them to add posts, delete posts, assign posts to specific tags, and approve posts drafts on that specific social channel. You can also set your own team members up with Full Posting access for any social channel they have permission to create posts for. Users with Full Posting access can view analytics for those social channels, as well as respond to the comments made on the posts of those social channels (for Facebook and Instagram).</p>\n<p><strong>Approval Required access:</strong></p>\n<p>This permission affects access to individual social channels. If you don’t want your clients or team members to add posts to the active queue of a specific social channel, but instead would like them to draft posts that you can review before they are scheduled to publish, setting them up with Approval Required access for that social channel is a great move. Users with Approval Required access can view analytics, but cannot respond to the comments made on the posts of those social channels.</p>\n<p><strong>What if my </strong><strong><em>client </em></strong><strong>needs to approve the posts my agency creates?</strong></p>\n<p>If posts need approval from clients, you‘ll set your staff up with Approval Required access and your clients with Full Posting access for the social channels they’ll be working on. From there, the flow would be for your staff to create posts within the drafts area and then request approval. The client will be able to review, edit, and approve those posts, at which point they’ll be moved to the active queue. Learn more about <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/665-managing-and-approving-draft-posts\" target=\"_self\">managing and approving draft posts</a>, and make sure to revisit the “Organization owner” section just above.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <h3>&nbsp;📝 Good-to-knows</h3>\n <ul>\n  <ul>\n   <li>If your staff members have Approval Required access on a social channel, all posts they add to that social channel’s drafts area will need to be approved by the client. It is not possible to pick and choose which posts require approval.</li>\n   <li>If your staff members have Approval Required access, they won’t have the ability to customize that channel's <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/514-setting-up-your-timezones-and-posting-schedules\" target=\"_self\">posting schedule</a>, modify any posts in the queue, rearrange the order in which they’ll be sent, or configure custom publishing times for posts that are already scheduled. These actions need to be completed by the organization owner, the client, or anyone else with Full Posting access.</li>\n   <li>At this time, all users within an organization are able to view all posts added to all tags via the publishing dashboard (<a href=\"https://publish.buffer.com/tags\">https://publish.buffer.com/tags</a>). This includes posts belonging to social channels that the user does not have Full Posting access or Approval Required access to. Without the appropriate permissions, however, the user will not be able to edit those posts, create posts, or access the queue for that channel. The only access they have is to view which posts are associated with which tags.</li>\n   <li>To change the order your channels appear in the channel menu, you can drag and drop into your desired order by clicking on a channel, moving it with your mouse, and then releasing it.</li>\n  </ul>\n </ul>\n <p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66b668cc067e9c553dc8259d/file-oHac4uioMb.gif\" alt=\"Buffer Publish - reordering channels in the left sidebar\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n</div>\n<h1 id=\"Managing-draft-approvals-from-clients-as-an-account-owner-qY0h_\">Managing draft approvals from clients as an account owner</h1>\n<h2>Creating another profile to have your drafts approved</h2>\n<p>As the owner of the Buffer organization, your Buffer account has permanent Full Posting access, meaning that any posts you create will be added to the queue and can't be sent for approval.

Using the publishing/engagement and analytics tools together allows you to maximize your team’s social media strategy by giving you access to schedule, publish, engage with, and analyze posts alongside your team with efficiency and ease.</p>\n<p>Keep reading to learn how to switch between organizations, as well as how to add more Buffer tools to your own organization.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01F65HY3KAB3EC77TS1GGQWJD7\">How do organizations work with tools?</h3>\n<p>Each organization you’re a part of could have access to different Buffer tools. For example, the organization you own may only have access to our publishing and engagement tools, while the organization you’re a user of may have access to our publishing, engagement, and analytics tools. This is dependent on the subscriptions that each organization has signed up for.</p>\n<h3 id=\"01F65HY3KAZ471CM4GPXNA9JX4\">How to add more tools to your own organization</h3>\n<p>If you’re the owner of the organization that doesn’t currently have access to the tool you’ve selected in the dashboard, you might choose to sign up for access. Or, if you’re not the owner, we’ll let you know who your administrator is so you can chat with them about signing up. Having access to all of Buffer’s tools allows you to maximize your team’s social media strategy.

Why?</b></p>\n <p><b>A: </b>Data is not collected in real time, and is instead collected in batches from each social network's API each day. In some cases, it can take up to 24 hours for new post data to be populated. Check back in a day or two and you'll see data!</p>\n <p><b>Q: Can I compare my data year over year?</b></p>\n <p>A: Currently, our platform allows you to compare data with the previous period, but it does not support automatic year-over-year comparisons for any selected period. However, once you've been using Buffer for over a year, you can select the current year as the date range in the analytics dashboard to view metrics and then create custom reports to compare with the previous year's data.

Whilst it's technically possible to connect Facebook accounts that have fewer than 100 fans, no data will be available.</li>\n <li>Six months of Facebook data is backfilled when you connect your account to Buffer. This could result in data for previous periods appearing lower than in Facebook Insights. Let’s say your Facebook account was connected on October 1, 2019. We’d go back and fetch data starting from April 1 2019. In January 2020, if you looked at your data in Buffer for the whole year of 2019, it wouldn’t match what you see in Facebook Insights for 2019 because we are only capturing nine months of data (the six months prior to connecting the account, which is the data we’ve backfilled, and the three months after connecting the account).</li>\n <li>Audience information for Facebook will take up to 24 hours to populate.</li>\n <li>Data on individual Facebook posts will not be updated indefinitely.

Whilst it's technically possible to connect business accounts that have fewer than 100 followers, no data will be available.</li>\n <li>30 days of Instagram data is backfilled when you connect your account to Buffer.</li>\n <li>Whilst we're able to backfill 30 days of Instagram post metrics when you connect your account, unfortunately, we’re not able to backfill Instagram stories. We are only able to start collecting that data from when your Instagram account is connected. Additionally, if your Instagram account becomes disconnected from Buffer, any stories you post during the time that it is disconnected will unfortunately not be pulled into Buffer.</li>\n <li>We are not able to backfill follower counts for Instagram. Instead, we provide an approximation of the previous growth on the account based on the current growth. To do this, we will look at the follower count from the past day, as well as the current follower count, and generate a graph of what growth could have looked like in the past (found in the <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/526-performance-overview\">Performance Overview</a> in your&nbsp;<i><b>Overview</b></i> tab). If you experienced larger fluctuations in follower counts (e.g. losing or gaining 100 followers) in a single day, the graph would not represent that and would instead reflect a smoother estimate based on the data we’re able to see when the account was connected.</li>\n <li>Audience information for Instagram will take up to 24 hours to populate. We are not able to backfill audience&nbsp;data, and are only able to start collecting this information from when the channel was connected to Buffer.</li>\n <li>We are only able to pull in impressions, the number of likes, and the number of comments for Instagram Reels due to limitations with Instagram's API. We are not able to pull in other Reels metrics at this time.</li>\n <li>We are not able to pull in data on IGTV posts.</li>\n <li>Data on individual Instagram posts will not be updated indefinitely. After a full calendar month has passed, we will no longer update the metrics for that post.</li>\n <li>The Instagram stories displayed will only be those that are original content and do not include posts and reels shared to your stories. Additionally, Buffer will not display any information on reshared stories.</li>\n <li>We are not able to pull in data for collaboration posts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01EKW2YHS8XDY3RH8XTC9F6B0D\">X/Twitter</h2>\n<ol>\n <li>30 days of X/Twitter data is backfilled when you connect your account to Buffer. This means that your data won’t match what you see in X/Twitter Analytics when you’re looking at a time period 30 days prior to the account being connected. Let’s say your X/Twitter account was connected on October 1, 2019. In January 2020, if you looked at your data in Buffer for the whole year of 2019, it wouldn’t match what you see in X/Twitter Analytics for 2019 because we are only capturing four months of data (the 30 days prior to connecting the account, which is the data we’ve backfilled, and the three months after connecting the account).</li>\n <li>Natively published posts can take up to 24 hours to appear within Analyze. Posts published by Buffer will appear immediately. (Natively published posts may show with '0' metrics until we have fetched the data).</li>\n <li>We are able to ingest data for 100 posts per day across natively published posts and posts published via Buffer. If scheduling more than 100 posts per day, all posts published through Buffer will appear in Analyze, however, some natively published posts may be missed.</li>\n <li>We are not able to backfill follower counts for X/Twitter. Follower counts will start populating when you connect your account to Buffer.</li>\n <li>Data on individual posts will not be updated indefinitely. After 20 days have passed, we will no longer update the metrics for that post.</li>\n <li>The number of posts you’ve shared, which is shown in the&nbsp;<i><b>Posts</b></i> tab and in your <i><b>Overview</b></i> tab, will not include replies or reposts. X/Twitter Analytics do include replies and reposts, so these numbers may differ.&nbsp;Learn more about the Posts tab in the article <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/527-analyzing-your-posts-within-your-analytics-dashboard\" target=\"_self\">Analyzing posts within your analytics dashboard</a>, and learn more about the Overview tab in the article <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/526-performance-overview\">Performance Overview</a>.</li>\n <li>When you share an X/Twitter thread, we are only able to pull in data for the first post but not the subsequent ones so your X/Twitter Analytics will not include data on subsequent posts in the thread.</li>\n <li>The engagement and engagement rate stats you see within your analytics dashboard will likely be a bit lower than what you see in X/Twitter Analytics. This is because the X/Twitter API version that we are using does not offer an aggregated engagements number for each post. Therefore, we are calculating the engagements ourselves, using a sum of likes, replies, reposts, quotes, link clicks, and profile clicks. Other engagement types, such as app opens, app install attempts, and hashtag clicks, are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;included.&nbsp;The engagement stats in X/Twitter Analytics on the other hand, will include all types of engagement.</li>\n <li>Boosted X/Twitter ads are not included at the moment.

If posts beyond this number keep on generating metrics, after they are pushed back from the 500th position, we won’t be showing those posts in the metrics.</li>\n <li>Our analytics support LinkedIn posts with multiple image files but not LinkedIn carousel posts that feature slideshows created with PDF files.</li>\n <li>We are able to pull in metrics for LinkedIn sponsored posts.</li>\n <li>We are unable to pull in metrics for reposts.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_01EKW3K6XYYY7PYYY1QVYN0J33\">Other articles that might be helpful</h2>\n<ul>\n <li><a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/527-analyzing-your-posts-within-your-analytics-dashboard\">Posts tab in Analyze</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/533-why-are-my-stats-different-between-the-posts-tab-and-the-overview-tab\" target=\"_self\">Why are my stats different between the Posts tab and the Overview tab?</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/516-why-isnt-my-ad-data-displayed-on-boosted-posts\" target=\"_self\">Analyzing ad data in boosted posts</a></li>\n</ul>\n    </article>",

You can see more about our <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/567-supported-channels\" target=\"_self\">supported channels and analytics capabilities here</a>.</li>\n  <li>Although you can add multiple tags to a post, each tag's metrics are independent and reflect the total followers at the time of the report, not just the increase attributed to that tag.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HD23SMJVV5R03JC2265K8Q3K\">Tag pulse</h3>\n<p>The tag pulse chart shows the effectiveness of your tagged posts from a higher level. This includes the number of new followers you gained, post impressions, post engagements, and post comments you gained during the period you used that tag. This gives you a quick assessment of your tag, without having to check individual social media posts across the various social media channels.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/653037df74982009a94e765b/file-pTUOoCI4Gl.png\" alt=\"Tag pulse - a quick snapshot of your tag performance\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HD23SMJVBDTNBR6K5MSKXBDE\">Tagged post metrics</h3>\n<div>\n The tagged post metrics chart provides a more comprehensive look at your metrics so you can see a view of your metrics while using the tag on posts.\n</div>\n<p>Below the graph is a timeline of your tagged posts to help you visualize how each post has influenced the metrics. For example, did any post create a spike in your metrics?</p>\n<div>\n Here are a few ways to use this chart:\n</div>\n<ul>\n <li>Click on the metrics at the top to see the respective graph.</li>\n <li>Hover over the graph to see a breakdown by channel.</li>\n <li>Click on the social icons at the top right of the chart to filter by channel.<a href=\"https://support.buffer.com/guide-media/01GV7PXTC3MNR28FPFGAA7G0B1\">&nbsp;</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/65b92d70a7493b27a932f6ef/file-fCdGMeh221.jpg\" alt=\"Buffer Analytics Tag metrics graph\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <div>\n  Note that the metrics indicate the total number across all channels for which you've scheduled posts with tags. For example, when looking at Total Followers, the number is not the sum of total followers from the tags, but rather the cumulative total followers for your connected channels at the time of reporting.\n </div>\n</div>\n<p>You can also click on any of the circular icons along the post timeline below the graph to see the posts that were published that day. You’ll then see the individual metrics for that post. If multiple posts were published on the same day, you can use the arrows to scroll through each post.<a href=\"https://support.buffer.com/guide-media/01GV7GHQPFMT2FC1W20FHWP2Z4\">&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6530384c25f8430475024938/file-qrE3xgybAD.png\" alt=\"Track the individual metrics of a post by its tag\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HD23SMJVXS0K3NEV02MBX236\">Post insights by tag</h3>\n<div>\n The tagged posts insight table will let you analyze the posts you’ve published using the relevant tag. The post with the greatest number of impressions will appear at the top of the table. If you wish, you can sort the posts by another metric. This is a great way to quickly identify your best performing post(s) using the tag.\n</div>\n<div>\n You can also filter the posts by certain keywords or hashtags to find specific posts.\n</div>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6530387d25f843047502493a/file-aqffgS88Kk.png\" alt=\"The tagged posts insight table will let you analyze the posts you’ve published using the relevant tag\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<h2 id=\"h_1229441a-7550-4c7a-b320-65325c9eafcf\">Adding charts to a custom report</h2>\n<div>\n Finally, you can add any of the tables and charts from your tag report to custom reports.

It’s ideal for quickly assessing the overall impact of a campaign.</p>\n<p>In contrast, <b>tag metrics</b> offer a detailed breakdown of how individual posts with the same tag performed over time. This view includes</p>\n<ul>\n <li>a selectable graph for exploring specific metrics</li>\n <li>a timeline of when tagged posts were published</li>\n <li>filtering options by social channel.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s especially useful for identifying which posts or platforms contributed most to campaign results. While tag pulse is great for a snapshot, tagged post metrics allow for deeper analysis and more informed decision-making.</p>\n    </article>",

When you select a date range in this table, you’ll see aggregate metrics attained. You will also see engagements for posts that were published before the date range if they continue to perform within the dates you’ve selected. This is different than the&nbsp;Posts tab, which only shows engagements on posts that were published during the chosen date range.&nbsp;Learn more in the article: <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/533-why-are-my-stats-different-between-the-posts-tab-and-the-overview-tab\">Why are my stats different between the Posts tab and the Overview tab</a><a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/533-why-are-my-stats-different-between-the-posts-tab-and-the-overview-tab\">?</a></p>\n<p>Buffer's analytics tools also include insights for boosted Facebook posts or promoted Instagram posts.

Once you've verified that all permissions have been accepted for ads (which can be done by checking your settings on the respective social account), some good next steps would be to check the following:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Was the post boosted using the same Facebook Profile that authorized Buffer access for the ad data?</li>\n <li>Additionally, are you boosting these posts from Facebook Business Manager or Ads Manager?</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"Selecting-the-right-date-range-to-see-your-boosted-posts-data-wP4ig\">Selecting the right date range to see your boosted posts data</h2>\n<p>If you're analyzing your boosted posts, there are situations where you might see boosted results under the Post Summary table but not under the Post Insights table.</p>\n<p>The Post Summary table shows the results of posts published and posts boosted during the selected date range. The Post Insights table shows the posts published during the selected date range, regardless of when they were boosted. This is why you might see posts that have had a $ spend on them, even though the results of that boost are not included in the summary table.</p>\n<p>Example: You published a post on July 1 and boosted it from August 1 to August 5. To see the overall results of the boosted post under the Post Summary table, the date range should include August 1 to August 5, when the post was boosted. To see the specific boosted post under the Post Insights table, the date range you select should include July 1, when the original post was published.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Learn more about <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/525-why-your-data-in-buffer-might-differ-from-your-native-analytics#h_01EKW2X08SJ19BVQ3R2S0X9ZQT\" target=\"_self\">Why your data in Buffer might differ from your native analytics</a>.</p>\n</div>\n    </article>",

As a reminder, the sender will be&nbsp;hello@youraccount.buffer.com&nbsp;and the subject line is \"Confirm your email address.\" If you find the email, mark it as \"Not Spam\" or move it to your proper inbox and follow the instructions on the email to complete your verification.</p><p><i><b>Still didn’t find it? Head to the next step.</b></i></p></li>\n <li>Head back to your Buffer web dashboard and click the button in the banner up top that says,&nbsp;<em><strong>Resend verification</strong></em>.

Because Buffer and these other extensions are updated frequently, you may experience new issues even if everything worked well before.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the extensions listed here don't always cause issues, and you may have a different extension that could be causing trouble. That being said, these are some of the more frequent extensions we’ve encountered and the settings we recommend.</p>\n<ul>\n <li>VPN - Most VPN applications should have the option to safelist Buffer.com.</li>\n <li>AdBlock: Turn off a feature called \"Fanboy's Annoyances\" could allow Buffer to work more smoothly.</li>\n <li>uBlock Origins or Private Badger: Safelist the following rules under \"My Filters\" tab:\n  <ul>\n   <li>buffer.com#@#.ss-social</li>\n   <li>buffer.com#@##sharer</li>\n   <li>@@/ss-social.$domain=buffer.com</li>\n  </ul></li>\n <li>NoScript: This Firefox add-on could block both buffer.com and the Buffer browser extension. Click on the NoScript add-on icon to \"Allow All This Page\"</li>\n <li>Ghostery: Add 'buffer.com' to the list of trusted sites.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"h_01GR99WSMRH7YJKZP06KWVXF6H\">Tips for using a VPN with Buffer</h2>\n<p>Some VPNs will block access to Buffer because of outdated security certificates or other configurations. You can test this by turning off your VPN. If you’re then able to successfully visit Buffer with your VPN turned off, there are some steps you can try within your VPN to enable access:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>On some VPNs you can adjust where your traffic is being routed through, in which case we recommend selecting a different country for your traffic origin.</li>\n <li>Within your VPN, safelist buffer.com and *.buffer.com</li>\n</ul>\n    </article>",

Apps like NordVPN, ExpressVPN, etc., let you browse the internet securely and privately, but they can sometimes connect to servers located far away from you, which can have an impact on your internet speed.</li>\n</ol>\n<ul>\n <ul>\n  <li><b>You may also need to check for threat protection products or extra protections within your within your VPN. </b>Try adding the <a href=\"http://buffer.com\">buffer.com</a> domain as an exception within these settings.</li>\n </ul>\n</ul>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n <li><strong>Try temporarily disabling all of your ad blockers</strong>. Ad-blocking apps like AdBlockPlus, AdAway, etc, remove ads and popups from a webpage to give you a better experience.

You can select between 1x, 3x, 5x per week, or choose a custom goal. Once you've selected your goal, Buffer will populate your posting schedule for you.</p>\n<p>For example, if you choose a goal of posting 3x per week, Buffer will create a posting schedule with three time slots across your posting schedule.</p>\n<p>In the GIF below, a posting goal of 3x per week is set, so three time slots were created in the posting schedule:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/6863e6478f9e265b36db6e50/file-pteu7tBwk7.gif\" alt=\"GIF of selecting a posting goal in Buffer\" style=\"max-width: 100%; \"></p>\n<p>If you'd like to adjust these times, you can take the steps below to make any edits necessary.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Adding-more-time-slots-to-match-your-posting-goals-uGP58\">Adding more time slots to match your posting goals</h3>\n<p>If you have an existing posting schedule set up, and you select a posting goal that is higher than your current number of time slots, you'll see the option to <i><b>Add Posting Times to Match Goal. </b></i>By clicking this, we'll add some recommended times to your posting schedule to make sure it matches the posting goal you've set.</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/67f836cafd61e46fc9de1fff/file-dLT16wGpj0.png\" alt=\"Add Posting Times to Match Goal button\" style=\"max-width: 100%; \"></p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p><a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/912-setting-posting-goals-in-buffer\">Learn more about how to track your posting goals here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"Adjusting-your-posting-schedule-YeLdl\">Adjusting your posting schedule</h3>\n<p>To add new times to your schedule, select the day or days you'd like to add the times to, as well as the time itself, and then click&nbsp;<strong><em>Add Posting Time</em></strong>.</p>\n<p>Times can be adjusted by clicking on the hours or minutes drop downs and changing as desired.

Every time you connect or disconnect a social channel from Buffer, your invoice will automatically adjust and your credit card will automatically be charged for the new total.</p>\n<p>Your Buffer invoice will include the total amount paid for the billing period, as well as all individual adjustments to your bill. Each adjustment to your pricing for adding or removing channel slots will be reflected as a line item in your invoice.</p>\n<p>Also on your invoice, you’ll see any credits or discounts applied to that month.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 <b>Notes:</b></p>\n <ul>\n  <li>Download your invoices and receipts from the <a href=\"https://account.buffer.com/billing\" target=\"_blank\">Billing area of your account</a>.</li>\n  <li>Your billing dates always remain the same, even if your plan was altered by adding or removing channel slots.</li>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Example: If you are on a monthly plan and your free trial moved to the paid plan on March 17th, your bill will always come on the 17th of each month. If you are on the annual plan, and your free trial moved to the paid annual plan on January 21st, your billing period would always be January 21st of this year through January 20th of the following year.</li>\n  </ul>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBWJ5P9Q51EPTAQP3S5XT8DR\">Billing for customers paying monthly</h2>\n<p>As a customer paying monthly, whenever you add a new channel, you'll be charged immediately.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBWRA2P0V3PC5NSV1XFVR46S\">Billing for customers paying annually</h2>\n<p>While the payment for additional social channels added to a monthly plan show on the next month's bill, changes to your annual plan result in an immediate charge. If paying annually, whenever you add a new social channel, you’ll immediately be charged a prorated amount for that channel in order to pay for that channel’s use across the remainder of your billing period.</p>\n<p>As an example, if you are on the Team plan, your social channels are each $120/year. If you start your billing period on June 1st with five social channels connected, your bill will be $600 for the year.</p>\n<p>Let’s say that six months later, on December 1st, you connect three more social channels. Right then, you will be charged for the prorated use of those social channels between December 1st and the end of your billing period; June 1st. Since we’re using nice clean numbers here, each of those three new social channels would come out to exactly half of the normal annual social channel cost, which is $60 each. The total, then, on December 1st would come to $180.</p>\n<p>Now let’s look at a real example:</p>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499e55416dd630a4b06c0/img-1655699-1695848933-741995491.png\" alt=\"Buffer annual invoice with two lines - the remaining time on the plan with 5 channels and the unused time on the plan with 4 channels\" style=\"width: 100%; \"></p>\n<p>This customer started their annual plan on June 29th with four social channels. On July 27th, they added one more social channel, to equal five total social channels on their annual plan.</p>\n<p>Here’s a breakdown of those line items:</p>\n<ol>\n <li>The first line item is the prorated charge for the remainder of the year on a Team plan for 5 social channels. The prorated cost from July 27th through June 29th of the following year is $554.57.</li>\n <li>The second line item reflects the subtraction of the original plan, which was the&nbsp; Team plan for four social channels. The prorated deduction from July 27th to June 29th of the following year comes out to -$443.65.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>When those two line items are added together, the final mid-billing period payment is created. The final cost for this customer to add an additional social channel to their existing annual plan came to $110.92.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FBWRP6XZEVFW16BJ7MNXKNRP\">What happens when I disconnect social channels?</h2>\n<p>If you're disconnecting a channel, make sure to <a href=\"https://support.buffer.com//support.buffer.com/article/539-adding-or-removing-a-channel-slot-from-buffer\" target=\"_self\">remove the channel slot</a> from your billing plan.</p>\n<p>On the monthly and annual plans, we will schedule the reduction in channels to occur at your next billing date.</p>\n<h2 id=\"What-currency-am-I-billed-in--D7zsQ\">What currency does Buffer bill in?</h2>\n<p>All Buffer subscriptions are billed in U.S. dollars (USD), regardless of your location.

When posting from the Omnibox, your design will be square.</li>\n <li>Create Canva designs one-by-one in a size optimized for each social network.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We’ll go through both of these below.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 The images you add to posts from Canva have the same file type and size requirements as all images added to your posts. You can view those requirements here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/617-ideal-image-sizes-and-formats-for-your-posts\" target=\"_self\">Ideal image sizes and formats for your posts</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FC6Y952SQDV4AZ2GC12MF5GB\">Creating your Canva design using the Omnibox</h3>\n<p>When creating a Canva design within Buffer’s Omnibox, your image will be 1080px x 1080px. This is a square image size, which is optimized across all networks. “Omnibox” is just a fancy word for “that first composer you type in prior to opening up your multiple composers where you can tailor each one of your posts separately.” Below are the steps to get you to the Omnibox.</p>\n<ol>\n <li>To open the composer, click the&nbsp;<i><b>+ New&nbsp;</b></i>button in the top navigation bar and select <i><b>Post</b></i>.</li>\n <li>*Select two or more social channels.</li>\n <li>Click the integrations button in the composer and then choose&nbsp;<em><strong>Canva&nbsp;</strong></em>from the menu that appears.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5d945a40a7f59feeca85c/file-86OKoQrpgk.png\" alt=\"Alt text: Buffer composer with arrows pointing to the media upload menu and its dropdown options, including Canva, Dropbox, Google Drive, and Unsplash.\" style=\"width: 613px; \"></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n <li>You'll be prompted to log into your Canva account if you're not already logged in.</li>\n <li>Create the perfect image for your posts or choose an image from your <em><strong>Projects</strong></em> in Canva, and then click <em><strong>Add to Buffer</strong></em> in the upper right to add the finished image to your Buffer post.</li>\n <li>*Click <em><strong>Customize for each network</strong></em> and fill out your post text for each social network.</li>\n <li>Schedule your post to publish at the date and time of your choice, or choose <i><b>Next Available</b></i> and <i><b>Schedule Post </b></i>to let your posting schedule will do the work for you!</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>*The asterisks above are just for reference for the “</em><a href=\"#h_01FC6YYDW1AXHJDTY3EA7Y7F07\" target=\"_self\"><em>Creating a Canva design for one social channel</em></a><em>” guidance below.</em></p>\n<div class=\"callout-red\">\n <p>⚠️ Images created in Buffer will not be saved in your Canva library for future use, but can be edited within Buffer and used again.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <h4 id=\"h_01HBW215D6509BM6JT0M7DSE25\">Limitations</h4>\n <ul>\n  <li>Only PNG files can be uploaded to Canva from Buffer.</li>\n  <li>There isn’t a way to upload multiple images at once.</li>\n  <li>The Canva Brand Kit cannot be accessed through Buffer.</li>\n  <li>We currently don't support animated video being uploaded via the Buffer/Canva integration. If an animated video is uploaded, it will appear as a photo. Ultimately, this comes down to the type of video file it is. We're not prepared to support animated videos at this time. As a workaround, if you download an animated video from Canva, be sure to export it as an MP4 file. Then head to Buffer and manually upload the MP4 video file. We will be able to publish the video on your behalf since we do support mp4 video files.</li>\n  <li>There isn’t a way to resize your Canva images like you can in Canva. Instead, if using the Omnibox, your image will be 1080 x 1080 (square), and if you end up clicking the <em><strong>Customizing for each social network</strong></em> button before adding in an image, the images will be the size for the social network you created your first image under. You'll find all sizes listed in the bullet point list just below.</li>\n </ul>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FC6YYDW1AXHJDTY3EA7Y7F07\">Creating a Canva design for one social channel</h3>\n<p>To create your design for one channel, you’ll follow all of the steps above that don’t have an asterisk(*) (<a href=\"#h_01FC6Y952SQDV4AZ2GC12MF5GB\" target=\"_self\">here’s a handy link back up there</a>).</p>\n<p>When posting to only one social channel, the size of the Canva template that comes up for you will depend on the social network you’ve chosen.</p>\n<p>These are default templates:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>Facebook: 940 x 788</li>\n <li>Instagram Post: 1080 x 1350</li>\n <li>Instagram Story: 1080 x 1920</li>\n <li>X/Twitter: 1600 x 900</li>\n <li>LinkedIn: 1200 x 627</li>\n <li>Pinterest: 1000 x 1500</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 If you’d like to publish the same design in multiple image sizes, we recommend first creating that design within your Canva account, and then hopping into Buffer to customize the template size. We share how to do this step-by-step in the next section.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FC9FMJ1ASJDMBA78TXQH4A6A\">Creating an image in Buffer from one of your saved Canva designs</h2>\n<p>If you are a Canva user and already have an image within your Canva library that you’d like to pull in to use within your Buffer post, you can pull it in right through your Buffer composer (no downloading from Canva and re-uploading to Buffer necessary!)</p>\n<p>There are two main benefits to pulling your Canva designs directly through Buffer:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>You can make quick edits to your image for the purpose of that specific post. You might edit some text or change the color, for instance.</li>\n <li>Your image will be placed on a template that is optimal for the social network you're posting to (<a href=\"#h_01FC6YYDW1AXHJDTY3EA7Y7F07\" target=\"_self\">the list of sizes can be seen above</a>), which allows you to cater to that social network.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FC7CW5NJENJ4MM1PVM61BVMX\">Accessing your Canva library</h3>\n<p>To find images already stored in your Canva library, you’ll follow a few steps.&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n <li>First, click the&nbsp;<i><b>+ New&nbsp;</b></i>button in the top navigation bar and select&nbsp;<i><b>Post</b></i>.</li>\n <li>Click the integrations button in the composer and then choose&nbsp;<em><strong>Canva&nbsp;</strong></em>from the menu that appears.</li>\n <li>Once Canva opens, in the left panel, click <em><strong>Projects.</strong></em>&nbsp;This should bring up all of your projects and folders.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499c45416dd630a4b06b1/img-1711538-1695848896-1255544845.png\" alt=\"Canva interface with an arrow pointing to the Folders tab\" style=\"width: 495px; \"></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n <li>Select the design you’d like to use.</li>\n <li>Adjust your design to fit the template provided for you (<a href=\"#h_01FC6Z0E4YYW7JX5PB3MJ4AA2W\" target=\"_self\">more on this in the section below</a>). As a reminder, the template provided is the optimal image size for the social network you chose in Step 1 above.</li>\n <li>Insert your image into your post by clicking <em><strong>Add to Buffer </strong></em>in the upper right-hand corner of the Canva editor. Here's a GIF of the entire process.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5da45483d237c76d683e7/file-j8oGBXhZEN.gif\" alt=\"Buffer composer - GIF of process to add Canva image to Buffer\" style=\"max-width: 100%; \"></p>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n <li>Finish your post text in Buffer and then add your post to the queue. It's now ready to be published at the date and time you scheduled it for.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 If at the same time, you’d like to use that same design to create an image adjusted to another social network, you’ll want to follow the steps in this section again. Note that in order to ensure the correct template is generated, you’ll want to click the <em><strong>x</strong></em> (\"1\" in the image below) to remove the image that was copied into that composer from the previous social network design you edited. Then click on the blank image (\"2\" in the image below) to start back at <a href=\"#h_01FC7CW5NJENJ4MM1PVM61BVMX\" target=\"_self\">Step 1 in this section</a>. Since you’re using one of your saved Canva designs, the steps should go pretty quickly for you.</p>\n <p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5da6c483d237c76d683ea/file-Qg4ngad6F4.png\" alt=\"Alt text: Buffer composer with a sneaker promo image uploaded and arrows pointing to the uploaded image and the “Drag &amp; drop or select a file” upload area.\" style=\"width: 419px; \"></p>\n <p>However, if you'd prefer to only follow these steps once and have all of your images be square, you have two options. First, you can choose Instagram as the social network to create the first image for (since Instagram’s template is square), and that image will then be added to the composers for all of the other social networks. Or, you can <a href=\"#h_01FC6Y952SQDV4AZ2GC12MF5GB\" target=\"_self\">head back up to the steps at the top of this article and use the Omnibox</a>. If you choose this option, once you hit Step 6 in the Omnibox section, simply click on <em><strong>Projects</strong></em> so that you can access your design of choice.</p>\n</div>\n<h3 id=\"h_01FC6Z0E4YYW7JX5PB3MJ4AA2W\">Adjusting your Canva design to fit the image size provided by Buffer’s Canva integration</h3>\n<p>Unless the saved Canva design you selected was already the same size as the template provided, you’ll need to reformat your image so that it fits optimally for you.</p>\n<p>There isn’t one way to manually adjust your image to fit into the template provided in Canva. You might choose to simply size it down or up, making just a bigger or smaller version of what you had originally, or you might decide to take this as an opportunity to move things around and completely rethink the design. The creative choice is yours!</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_01FC9FN129VVQECF1WP735JKEQ\">Editing the Canva images you created in Buffer</h2>\n<p>While you aren’t able to see the Canva designs you create in Buffer inside your Canva library, you are able to edit those images within Buffer after they’ve been scheduled to your queue and even after they’ve already been published.</p>\n<p>Editing your Canva designs within Buffer will allow you to differentiate them before using them again, or it can just give you the opportunity to correct a mistake before it publishes. Let’s get into how to edit your Canva designs.</p>\n<h3 id=\"h_01HBW215D71GWEYNVWZHG54REV\">How to edit a Canva design from your queue before it publishes</h3>\n<p>You’ll go through a few steps to edit Canva posts within your queue before they publish to your social channel.</p>\n<ol>\n <li>Find the post in your queue and click <em><strong>Edit (pencil icon)</strong></em>.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/66c73f6b067e9c553dc832bb/file-bU3nctXbjA.jpg\" alt=\"Pencil icon to edit post\" style=\"width: 648.984px; \"></p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n <li>Hover over the image until the Canva logo (\"C\") appears and then click it to open Canva.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/68a5daa0483d237c76d683ed/file-kOFdSLMsZk.png\" alt=\"Buffer composer with a sneaker promo image and an arrow pointing to the Canva icon, indicating the image was imported from Canva.\" style=\"width: 503px; \"></p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n <li>Edit the image in the Canva editor and then click <em><strong>Add to Buffer</strong></em> in the upper right to add the updated image into your Buffer post.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><img src=\"//d33v4339jhl8k0.cloudfront.net/docs/assets/64cb6cf86d4a3e191f237e66/images/651499c76241295a81ba6dd2/img-1711538-1695848898-104045554.png\" alt=\"Image in the Canva editing tool with an arrow pointing to the Add to Buffer button\" style=\"width: 496px; \"></p>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n <li>Finally, click <em><strong>Save</strong></em> on your post to save the refreshed version to your queue.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 Even if scheduled to their queues at the same time, each queued Canva image will need to be edited separately within its respective queue.

You'll need to create a (free) <a href=\"https://zapier.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Zapier account</a> to do so, then can link your Buffer account to set up this \"Zap\"/trigger.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 You will need to create multiple versions of this Zap if you'd like posts to be sent to multiple channels.</p>\n</div>\n<h2 id=\"Sharing-Media-to-Buffer-via-the-Zapier-Integration-kmgfr\">Sharing Media to Buffer via the Zapier Integration</h2>\n<div>\n The Zapier integration can be used to pass an image, images for a carousel post, or a video over to Buffer. While this can help you to efficiently create and schedule content, you will need to ensure that the URL you include is a direct link to the media that Zapier is passing along to Buffer.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n Many cloud drives or image hosting services provide “share links” for the media they host. That said, not all of these share links will allow third-party services to access and download the content automatically. Therefore, regardless of whether a cloud drive or image hosting service is used, you will need to locate and include the direct link for the media within the Zapier integration.\n</div>\n<div>\n <b>Example:</b>\n</div>\n<div>\n To illustrate the above, we’ll look at two different types of URLs from Google Drive.&nbsp;\n</div>\n<div>\n When attempting share an image or a video from Google Drive, the service will provide a “share link” similar to the below URL (<i>with the FILEIDHERE</i> portion being the unique id for the media):\n</div>\n<div>\n <code class=\"inline-code\">https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILEIDHERE/view?usp=sharing</code>\n</div>\n<div>\n While this URL allows you to share with other users, it doesn’t provide a direct link to the media for services like Buffer. Instead, you would need to use a link like the following:\n</div>\n<div>\n <code class=\"inline-code\">https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&amp;id=FILEIDHERE</code>\n</div>\n<div>\n The above URL would allow Buffer to directly access the media to include it in the post that is created.\n</div>\n<div>\n Each cloud drive or image hosting service will have their own types of links for media. Using those will be key to ensuring that your Zap works properly.&nbsp;\n</div>\n    </article>",

These are all web automation tools, described as the \"glue\" that connects hundreds of other web apps. In these tools you're able to create workflows (known as Zaps in Zapier, Applets in IFTTT, and Scenarios in Make).

The channel that you choose is tied to your IFTTT account as opposed to be tied to a specific applet that you create. Therefore, it is not possible to create separate applets where a different channel is chosen. The only workaround for this would be to set up completely separate IFTTT accounts under different email addresses.</p>\n<p>We have found this to be one of the key reasons that some customers choose to use <a href=\"https://zapier.com/app/dashboard\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Zapier</a> instead of IFTTT.

Our top tips include using a unique, authentic, and active Facebook Page for each Instagram business or creator account, avoiding allowing multiple people logging into the Facebook or Instagram accounts that authorized the connection to Buffer, and avoiding logging in and out of multiple Instagram accounts on a frequent basis.</p>\n<p>In this article:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><a href=\"#h_a02b84d9-ea51-464e-a08b-c77205fcf71b\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">It’s ideal for only one person to have native access to your social channels</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_c9d55e09-3fdf-4a4f-8cac-33d2f9af5b05\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">It’s important that each of your social channels is authentic and active</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#h_678b09f1-9b96-44b3-b780-50155bdd78d0\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"undefined\">Confirming your social channel's email address helps prove its authenticity</a></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"h_a02b84d9-ea51-464e-a08b-c77205fcf71b\">It’s ideal for only one person to have native access to your social channels</h2>\n<p>For Facebook and Instagram, it’s best to have only one person access the native social channel. This is the intended use for these platforms, and we’ve seen that when Facebook notices that the account is being accessed from many IP addresses, it sometimes results in a lack of functionality, such as suspensions, errors, and frequent disconnections.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_c9d55e09-3fdf-4a4f-8cac-33d2f9af5b05\">It’s important that each of your social channels is authentic and active</h2>\n<p>Along with having an authentic and active Facebook Page connected to each Instagram business account, ensure that each of your Instagram business accounts is also active with real followers, and used for an authentic purpose. If Instagram or Facebook sense unauthentic behavior, they can disconnect your API access without explanation.</p>\n<h2 id=\"h_678b09f1-9b96-44b3-b780-50155bdd78d0\">Confirming your social channel's email address helps prove its authenticity</h2>\n<p>Each Instagram account you have should have an email address connected to it, and it should be confirmed. The best way to do this is to check each of your Instagram accounts' settings to make sure there isn't a \"Confirm Email\" link listed below the email address.</p>\n    </article>",

These might include alerts about expired social channels, post failures, failed payments, and new feature advice. These emails will be sent to the account owner. Because of this, it's important to consider who the account owner should be, and which email address is used.

No. What we encourage is that if you manage more than 300 channels, split them across multiple Buffer accounts in order for you to maintain the best performance and speeds.</p>\n<p>If you're currently managing more than 300 channels and you're noticing any dips in performance, we'd love to work alongside you to find the right split for your business and help transfer some of your channels from one Buffer account to another.

While this can be frustrating, it's good to keep in mind that this is normal behavior and is usually the result of the social network making a change to keep your account safe and secure.</p>\n<p>Connections between Buffer and your social channels require access tokens, which can expire for a number of reasons, including password changes and explicit lifespans of an access token (dictated by the social networks themselves). This guide aims to provide a deeper knowledge of access tokens, and how and when they might expire, resulting in you needing to refresh a channel.</p>\n<div class=\"callout-blue\">\n <p>📝 We'd recommend enabling the \"Post Failures\" notification so you'll receive an email whenever a post fails to send, which could indicate that your channel's access token has expired. You can do this by clicking your profile avatar at the top right of your dashboard and then clicking on <em><strong>Preferences</strong></em>. From there, select the <em><strong>Notifications</strong></em> tab and toggle the \"Post Failures\" notification to <em><strong>Enabled</strong></em>. <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/506-enabling-notifications-in-buffer\">Learn more about Enabling Notifications here</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<p>In this article:</p>\n<ol>\n <li><a href=\"#General-guidelines-H5HMf\">General guidelines</a></li>\n <li><a href=\"#Social-network-specific-guidelines-OCY1P\">Social network specific guidelines</a>\n  <ol>\n   <li><a href=\"#Facebook-and-Instagram-hVQg_\">Facebook and Instagram </a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"#XTwitter-ir4We\">X/Twitter</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"#LinkedIn-XsjVn\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"#Pinterest-AcZb_\">Pinterest</a></li>\n  </ol></li>\n</ol>\n<h2 id=\"General-guidelines-H5HMf\">General guidelines</h2>\n<p>Regardless of social network, the access token will expire and you will need to refresh your channel under the following circumstances:</p>\n<ul>\n <li><strong>If the username or password of the social channel is changed:</strong> Changing your social channel username or password will result in that social network removing Buffer's access to your account, because the original credentials that were used to authenticate the account no longer exist. To correct this, head over to your Buffer dashboard and refresh the channel immediately after changing your username or password.</li>\n <li><strong>If Buffer's access to the social network has been revoked:</strong> Each social network has an area where third party apps can be granted authorization to access your account. If Buffer's access is revoked or altered, this will result in the loss of the access token and your social channel will need to be reauthorized. Below you will find links to the area within each social network where third party apps can be granted authorization:\n  <ul>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/accounts/manage_access/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/settings/applications\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">X/Twitter</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/permitted-services\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">LinkedIn</a></li>\n   <li><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.co.uk/settings/apps\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pinterest</a></li>\n  </ul></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"Social-network-specific-guidelines-OCY1P\">Social network specific guidelines</h2>\n<p>In addition to the reasons outlined above, each social network also has their own policies on access tokens and when they might expire.</p>\n<h3 id=\"Facebook-and-Instagram-hVQg_\">Facebook and Instagram</h3>\n<p>We have found that Facebook and Instagram accounts connected to Buffer do require refreshing more often than some other social networks. Facebook state that access tokens <em>usually</em> have a lifetime of <em>about</em> 60 days, which means your account will need to be refreshed at that point. The use of words like \"usually\" and \"about\" in their policy does make it a little ambiguous, and therefore tricky for us to estimate when your channel might need refreshing. We're sorry we can't provide a more definitive answer on this one.</p>\n<p>Below are some of the other reasons an access token may expire:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>You no longer have admin access (for Facebook Pages).</li>\n <li>You are publishing identical posts to several accounts at exactly the same time.</li>\n <li>You are logging into your account from many different IP addresses (for instance, if several folks have the email and password login information for your account).</li>\n <li>You are often logging in and out of several different accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Facebook's policy wording:</p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>User access tokens come in two forms: short-lived tokens and long-lived tokens. Short-lived tokens usually have a lifetime of about an hour or two, while long-lived tokens usually have a lifetime of about 60 days. You should not depend on these lifetimes remaining the same - the lifetime may change without warning or expire early.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"XTwitter-ir4We\">X/Twitter</h3>\n<p>X/Twitter accounts connected to Buffer should not require frequent refreshing, since the access tokens they issue do not have specific lifespans or expiry dates. That said, we do see the access token for X/Twitter channels expiring from time to time, usually due to the X/Twitter channel being suspended due to duplicate content being published, or other spam-like behavior. Learn more about <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/561-using-twitter-with-buffer\">Using X/Twitter with Buffer</a>.</p>\n<p>X's/Twitter's policy wording:</p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Access tokens are not explicitly expired. An access token will be invalidated if a user explicitly revokes an application in the their Twitter account settings, or if Twitter suspends an application. If an application is suspended, there will be a note on the apps.twitter.com page stating that it has been suspended.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"LinkedIn-XsjVn\">LinkedIn</h3>\n<p>LinkedIn channels connected to Buffer will require refreshing every 60 days, since that's the lifespan of the access tokens granted by LinkedIn. Other reasons that an access token from LinkedIn might expire include:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>You no longer have Super Admin access (for LinkedIn pages).</li>\n <li>You are publishing identical posts to several LinkedIn accounts at exactly the same time. Learn more about our <a href=\"https://buffer.helpscoutdocs.com/article/645-best-practices-for-scheduling-content\" target=\"_blank\">Best practices for scheduling content</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>LinkedIn's policy wording:</p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Access Tokens stay valid until the number of seconds returned in the *expires_in field in the API response. A user can go through the OAuth flow on multiple clients (browsers or devices) and simultaneously hold multiple valid access tokens as long as the same scope is requested. If the user requests a different scope than the previously granted scope, then all the previous access tokens are invalidated.</p>\n <p>*expires_in — The number of seconds remaining, from the time it was requested, before the token will expire. Currently, all access tokens are issued with a 60 day lifespan.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"Pinterest-AcZb_\">Pinterest</h3>\n<p>Pinterest channels connected to Buffer should not require frequent refreshing, since the access tokens they issue do not have specific lifespans or expiry dates.</p>\n<p>Pinterest's policy wording:</p>\n<blockquote>\n <p>Your app will call the API to exchange the authorization code for an access token, which is a permanent credential (unless the user revokes your access). You'll use the access token to perform actions on Pinterest on your user's behalf.</p>\n</blockquote>\n    </article>",
